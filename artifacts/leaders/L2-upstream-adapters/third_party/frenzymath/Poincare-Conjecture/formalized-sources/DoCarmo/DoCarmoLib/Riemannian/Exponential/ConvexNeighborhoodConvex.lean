# Convex neighborhoods: minimizing geodesics with interior in the ball (do Carmo Ch. 3, §4)

This file assembles the convex-neighborhood content of do Carmo's Proposition 4.2 modulo its one
genuine analytic crux. The pieces it composes are all available:

* `exists_convex_join_ball` — the joining geodesic `γ` between any two points of a small
  `closedBall p β`, on an open time window, with the arclength-proportional length
  `ℓ(γ|[0,t]) = √⟨w,w⟩ · t` and the radial upper bound `d(q₁,q₂) ≤ √⟨w,w⟩` (`≤` half of Prop 3.6);
* `edist_segment_of_arclength` — arclength-proportional distance realization propagated from the
  endpoints to the whole segment;
* `exists_forall_minimizing_geodesic_interior_ball` — the interior-arc-in-ball deduction from the
  minimizing property and the conserved speed.

The single remaining input is the matching **lower** bound `d(q₁,q₂) ≥ √⟨w,w⟩` — do Carmo's
statement that short radial geodesics *realize* the distance (Prop 3.6), phrased *base-uniformly*
over the ball of centers. That is the residual crux of `prop:dc-ch3-4-2`: no lower-semicontinuous
normal radius (nor a moving-base Gauss estimate) is yet available. Here it enters as the explicit
hypothesis `Hlb`.

`Hlb` must carry both a **geodesic** hypothesis and an initial-velocity **smallness** bound
`‖w‖ < ρH`: it is exactly do Carmo Prop 3.6 ("a *short geodesic* near `p` realizes the distance
between its endpoints"), stated base-uniformly. These are essential — without them the statement is
unsound: for an arbitrary constant-speed curve `γ` one always has `d(q₁,q₂) ≤ ℓ = length(γ)`, so a
bare `ℓ ≤ d(q₁,q₂)` would force *every* constant-speed curve to be minimizing, which is false on any
manifold of dimension `≥ 2` (a constant-speed loop through `q₁ = q₂` has `ℓ > 0 = d`). The joining
geodesic of `exists_convex_join_ball` supplies precisely the geodesic-plus-small-velocity data `Hlb`
needs, so the reduction stays honest.

Main result: `exists_minimizing_interior_ball_of_lower_bound` — given `Hlb`, every pair of points
of a small `closedBall p β` is joined by a **minimizing** geodesic (arclength-proportional distance
realization) whose open arc lies in the ball. This is the strong-convexity content of Prop 4.2
except the uniqueness clause; combined with `Hlb` it reduces the proposition to that lower bound.

/-- **Math.** **Minimizing geodesics with interior in the ball (do Carmo Prop 4.2, modulo the
lower-bound crux and uniqueness).** Suppose the *base-uniform lower bound* `Hlb` holds: there are
radii `βH, ρH > 0` such that every **geodesic** `γ` (on an open window `(lo, hi) ⊋ [0,1]`) joining
two points `q₁, q₂` within `βH` of `p`, with **small** initial chart velocity `w` (`‖w‖ < ρH`) and
constant-speed length `ℓ(γ|[0,t]) = ℓ·t`, has `ℓ ≤ d(q₁, q₂)` (short geodesics realize the distance
— do Carmo's Proposition 3.6, base-uniform). The geodesic and smallness hypotheses are essential:
for an arbitrary constant-speed curve one always has `d(q₁,q₂) ≤ ℓ`, so a bare `ℓ ≤ d(q₁,q₂)` would
force every constant-speed curve minimizing, false on dimension `≥ 2`. Then there is `β > 0` such
that any two points of `closedBall p β` are joined by a geodesic `γ` on `[0,1]` that is *minimizing*
(`d(γ s, γ t) = |s-t| · d(q₁, q₂)`) and whose open arc `γ((0,1))` lies in `closedBall p β`. This is
do Carmo's strong convexity except the uniqueness clause. -/

/-- **Math.** **Convex neighborhoods (do Carmo Proposition 4.2), reduced to two isolated cruxes.**
Given the base-uniform lower bound `Hlb` (short geodesics of small initial velocity near `p` realize
the distance, `prop:dc-ch3-3-6` base-uniform) and the *local uniqueness* `Huniq` of minimizing
geodesics near `p`
(any two constant-speed distance-realizing geodesics joining the same pair of points near `p`
coincide on `[0,1]` — do Carmo's reading of the injectivity of `exp_{q₁}`), there is `β > 0` such
that the **closed** geodesic ball `closedBall p β` is strongly convex
(`def:dc-ch3-4-2-stronglyconvex`). This is the full Proposition 4.2 for the closed ball, assembled
from the totally-normal joining geodesic and its metric payload; only `Hlb` and `Huniq` remain.

The closed ball is used deliberately: the literal open-ball statement is unsatisfiable at a
boundary diagonal `q₁ = q₂ ∈ ∂ B_β(p)`, where the constant minimizing geodesic's interior `{q₁}`
is not in the *open* ball. -/
