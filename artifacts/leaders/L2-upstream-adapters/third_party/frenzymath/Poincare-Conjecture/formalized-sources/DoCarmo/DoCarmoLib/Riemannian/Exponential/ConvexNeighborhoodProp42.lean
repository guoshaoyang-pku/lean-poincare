# Convex neighborhoods: discharging the base-uniform lower bound (do Carmo Ch. 3, §4)

The reductions of `ConvexNeighborhoodConvex.lean` package do Carmo's Proposition 4.2 for the closed
ball modulo two isolated hypotheses:

* `Hlb` — the *base-uniform lower bound*: short geodesics of small initial velocity near `p` realize
  the distance between their endpoints (`prop:dc-ch3-3-6`, phrased base-uniformly);
* `Huniq` — the *local uniqueness* of minimizing geodesics near `p`.

`Hlb` is now a theorem: `exists_movingBase_prop36_lower_bound`
(`MovingBaseProp36LowerBound.lean`) proves exactly the `Hlb` statement, base-uniformly over the ball
of centres, by transporting the Gauss radius comparison to the moving-base geodesic flow family.

This file feeds that proof into the two reductions, so:

* `exists_minimizing_interior_ball` — **unconditional** now: for every `p` there is `B₀ > 0` such
  that any two points of a small `closedBall p β` are joined by a *minimizing* geodesic whose open
  arc lies in the ball (the existence + minimizing + interior clauses of strong convexity, with no
  remaining hypothesis);
* `exists_stronglyConvex_closedBall_of_uniq` — the *whole* of do Carmo's Proposition 4.2 for the
  closed ball, reduced to the single residual `Huniq`.

The closed ball is used deliberately: the literal open-ball statement of
`def:dc-ch3-4-2-stronglyconvex` is unsatisfiable at a boundary diagonal `q₁ = q₂ ∈ ∂ B_β(p)`, where
the constant minimizing geodesic's interior `{q₁}` is not in the *open* ball.

/-- **Math.** **Minimizing geodesics with interior in the ball (do Carmo Prop 4.2, existence +
minimizing + interior, unconditional).** For every `p` there is `B₀ > 0` such that for every
`0 < β ≤ B₀`, any two points `q₁, q₂` of `closedBall p β` are joined by a geodesic `γ` on `[0,1]`
that is *minimizing* (`d(γ s, γ t) = |s-t| · d(q₁, q₂)`) and whose open arc `γ((0,1))` lies in
`closedBall p β`. This is the strong-convexity content of do Carmo's Proposition 4.2 except the
uniqueness clause; the base-uniform lower bound crux `Hlb` is now discharged by
`exists_movingBase_prop36_lower_bound`. -/

/-- **Math.** **Convex neighborhoods (do Carmo Proposition 4.2), reduced to uniqueness alone.**
Given the *local uniqueness* `Huniq` of minimizing geodesics near `p` (any two constant-speed
distance-realizing geodesics joining the same pair of points near `p` coincide on `[0,1]` — do
Carmo's reading of the injectivity of `exp_{q₁}`), there is `β > 0` such that the **closed**
geodesic ball `closedBall p β` is strongly convex (`def:dc-ch3-4-2-stronglyconvex`). The
base-uniform lower
bound `Hlb` is discharged internally by `exists_movingBase_prop36_lower_bound`, so `Huniq` is the
sole remaining hypothesis. This is the full Proposition 4.2 for the closed ball. -/
