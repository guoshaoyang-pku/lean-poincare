# Jointly smooth endpoint maps for autonomous local flows

The implicit-function construction in `GenericFlowCInfty` gives smooth
dependence on the initial value as a map into continuous curves.  This file
adds the small but important autonomous-ODE trick that turns that result into
joint smoothness in initial value and time: make the elapsed time a constant
state parameter and take a fixed-time endpoint of the augmented field
`(z,a) ↦ (a • f z, 0)`.

/-- **Math.** A smooth autonomous vector field on a finite-dimensional Banach
space has a jointly smooth local flow.  The endpoint map is obtained from the
smooth fixed-time endpoint of the augmented field `(z,a) ↦ (a • f z, 0)`;
ODE uniqueness identifies it with the original trajectory at time `t`.
