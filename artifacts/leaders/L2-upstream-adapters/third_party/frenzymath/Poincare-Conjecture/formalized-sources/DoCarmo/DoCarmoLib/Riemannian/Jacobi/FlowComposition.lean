# Poincaré Ch. 1, §1.4 — composition engine for the geodesic-flow derivative

The differential of the exponential map (`cor:dc-ch5-2-5`)
is computed by chaining, along a compact geodesic `γ = γ_v : [0,1] → M`, an
alternating sequence of

* **within-chart flow steps** — the time-`τ` geodesic-flow endpoint map of the
  coordinate spray, strictly differentiable in its initial condition, whose
  derivative transports the chart Jacobi variational pair
  (`IsJacobiFieldAlongOn.variational_transport`), and
* **chart junctions** — the state transition `stateTransition β β'`, strictly
  differentiable, whose derivative carries the chart-`β` variational pair to the
  chart-`β'` variational pair of the same field
  (`stateTransition_jacobiVarPair`).

Both kinds of link are maps `E × E → E × E` (a *state* is a chart position
paired with a chart velocity) with a known strict derivative, and both *carry
one marked vector to the next* — the marked vector being the Jacobi variational
pair of the field at the boundary time/chart. This file supplies the two
context-free ingredients of the assembly:

* `hasStrictFDerivAt_comp_chain` — the **composition engine**: a finite chain of
  strictly differentiable maps `f 0, …, f (n-1)`, each sending its base point to
  the next (`f i (x i) = x (i+1)`) and its derivative sending a marked vector to
  the next (`L i (p i) = p (i+1)`), composes to a strictly differentiable map at
  `x 0` whose derivative sends `p 0` to `p n`. This is the inductive backbone of
  the flow-derivative gluing: instantiate `f i` with the alternating flow-step /
  junction maps, `x i` with the flow state at boundary `i`, and `p i` with the
  Jacobi variational pair there.

* `jacobiVarPair_of_left_eq_zero` — the **initial datum**: where the field
  vanishes (`J c = 0`), the variational pair reduces to `(0, DJ^α c)`; at the
  start of `γ = γ_v` in the chart at `p` this is exactly `(0, Z)`, the value the
  composed derivative must be evaluated on to read off `d(exp_p)_v(Z)`.

/-- **Math.** **The composition engine for the flow-derivative gluing.** Let
`f 0, …, f (n-1) : F → F` be maps, each strictly differentiable at a base point
`x i` with derivative `L i`, and suppose the base points chain
(`f i (x i) = x (i+1)`) and a family of marked vectors chains along the
derivatives (`L i (p i) = p (i+1)`). Then there are a map `F₀ : F → F` and a
continuous linear map `D₀` such that `F₀` is strictly differentiable at `x 0`
with derivative `D₀`, `F₀` sends `x 0` to `x n`, and `D₀` sends the initial
marked vector `p 0` to the terminal one `p n`.

Instantiated with the alternating within-chart flow-step and chart-junction maps
of a compact geodesic `γ`, with `p i` the chart Jacobi variational pair of a
manifold Jacobi field at boundary `i`, this glues the one-chart derivative
identities into a single strict derivative sending the initial variational pair
`(0, Z)` to the variational pair of `Y_Z` at time `1` — the coordinate content
of `d(exp_p)_v(Z) = Y_Z(1)`.

/-- **Math.** **Composition engine, marked-chain factored form.** Same hypotheses
as `hasStrictFDerivAt_comp_chain` on the maps `f i` and their base points `x i`,
but the marked-vector chaining is factored *out* of the existential: the single
composed map `F₀` and derivative `D₀` obtained from `f, L, x` transport *every*
family `p : ℕ → F` that chains along the derivatives (`L i (p i) = p (i+1)`),
sending `p 0` to `p n`.

This is the form the flow-derivative gluing needs: one composed flow derivative
`D₀`, built from the geodesic's flow-step and chart-junction links alone, must
transport the Jacobi variational pair of *every* manifold Jacobi field along `γ`
simultaneously — the pair family `p` varies with the field while `f, L, x` (hence
`D₀`) do not.

/-- **Math.** **Composition engine with neighbourhood semantics.** Same data as
`hasStrictFDerivAt_comp_chain'` (maps `f i` strictly differentiable at chaining
base points `x i`), together with a neighbourhood `W i` of each base point. Then
the composed map `F₀` comes with a neighbourhood `W₀` of `x 0` on which it is
computed by *iterating the links*: every `z ∈ W₀` has an orbit `orb` with
`orb 0 = z` and `orb (i+1) = f i (orb i)`, whose `i`-th state still lies in `W i`
for `i < n`, and `F₀ z = orb n`.

`W₀` is the intersection of the finitely many preimages `(f (i-1) ∘ ⋯ ∘ f 0)⁻¹(W i)`;
it is a neighbourhood of `x 0` because each partial composite is continuous at
`x 0` (being strictly differentiable there) and sends `x 0` to `x i`.

This is the missing engine step for rung 4 of the exponential differential: the
base-point-only conclusion of `hasStrictFDerivAt_comp_chain'` pins the chain down
at the single state of `γ`, whereas `d(exp_p)_v` is a derivative *in `v`* and so
needs the chain to compute the geodesic endpoint for all *nearby* initial states.
Fed the per-piece neighbourhood data of `exists_geodesic_flowstep_partition`, the
orbit `orb i` is the chart-`β i` state, at the partition time `τ i`, of the
geodesic emanating from the initial state `z`.
