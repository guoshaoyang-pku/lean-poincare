# A spray flow state *is* the chart state of its base curve

Ported into DoCarmoLib from the Morgan–Tian / Poincaré Ch.1, §1.4 development
(toward `cor:dc-ch5-2-5`).

The geodesic flow of `exists_geodesic_flow_step` is a curve `ζ : ℝ → E × E` in
the chart-`q` state space solving the spray ODE
`ζ' = geodesicSprayCoord g q ζ.1 ζ.2`. Its *base curve* is the manifold curve
`sprayBase q ζ = φ_q⁻¹ ∘ ζ.1`, and the spray equation says precisely that the
two components of `ζ` are the chart position and the chart velocity of that base
curve:

* `sprayFlow_eq_chartState` — `ζ τ = (φ_q(c τ), (φ_q ∘ c)'(τ))` where
  `c = sprayBase q ζ`.

This is the semantic content that the manifold wrappers of the flow step need in
order to describe the endpoint map `flowEnd = (fun z ↦ Z z τ)` at states `z`
*other than* the base state of the reference geodesic: for every such `z`, `Z z`
is the chart-state curve of the geodesic `sprayBase q (Z z)` that emanates from
`z`. Without it, the flow step is only pinned down at the one base state, which
is too weak to identify the composed chain with the exponential map — the
differential `d(exp_p)_v` is a *neighbourhood* notion in `v`.

/-- **Math.** **A spray flow state is the chart state of its own base curve.**
If `ζ : ℝ → E × E` solves the geodesic spray ODE in the chart at `q` on an open
set `J`, and its position component stays in the chart target, then at every
`τ ∈ J` the pair `ζ τ` is exactly the chart-`q` state
`(φ_q(c τ), (φ_q ∘ c)'(τ))` of its base curve `c = sprayBase q ζ`.

The first component is `chartReading_sprayBase` (`φ_q ∘ φ_q⁻¹ = id` on the
target); the second is `hasDerivAt_chartReading_sprayBase`, i.e. the first half
`x' = w` of the spray equation.
