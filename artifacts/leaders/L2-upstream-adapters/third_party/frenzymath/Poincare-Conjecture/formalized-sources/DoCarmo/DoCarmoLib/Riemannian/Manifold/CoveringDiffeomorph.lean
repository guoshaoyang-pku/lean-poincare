# Covering map + simply connected ⟹ diffeomorphism (do Carmo Ch. 7, §3, proof of Thm 3.1)

`CoveringMapConclusion.lean` proved do Carmo's Lemma 3.3: a metric-expanding smooth
local diffeomorphism `f : M → M'` out of a complete manifold `M` is a **covering
map**. The proof of the Hadamard theorem (do Carmo Ch. 7, §3.4) closes with the
sentence

> From Lemma 3.3, `exp_p` is a covering map. Since `M` is simply connected, `exp_p`
> is a diffeomorphism.

This file formalises that final topological+smooth step, independently of the
Jacobi-field input `lem:dc-ch7-3-2` (which supplies "`exp_p` is a local
diffeomorphism") and independently of the exponential map itself: it is a fact
about an **abstract** metric-expanding local diffeomorphism.

* `IsCoveringMap.bijective_of_simplyConnected` — the classical covering-space fact:
  a covering map out of a **preconnected, nonempty** total space `E` onto a
  **simply connected, locally path connected** base `X` is **bijective**. Proof:
  the identity `X → X` lifts (uniquely, mathlib's
  `IsCoveringMap.existsUnique_continuousMap_lifts`) to a continuous global section
  `s`; `f ∘ s = id` gives surjectivity, and `s ∘ f = id` follows because `s ∘ f`
  and `id` are two continuous lifts of `f` through the same point of the connected
  space `E`, hence equal (`IsCoveringMap.eq_of_comp_eq`), giving injectivity.
* `IsCoveringMap.homeomorphOfSimplyConnected` — packages it as a homeomorphism
  `E ≃ₜ X` (a continuous open bijection).
* `DCExpandsMetric.diffeomorphOfSimplyConnected` — the do Carmo Ch. 7 assembly:
  Lemma 3.3 (`isCoveringMap`) + bijectivity + the smooth upgrade
  `IsLocalDiffeomorph.diffeomorphOfBijective` produce a `Diffeomorph I I' M M' ∞`.

/-- **Math.** do Carmo Ch. 7, §3, final step of the proof of Theorem 3.1
(Hadamard). Let `f : M → M'` be a smooth local diffeomorphism between Riemannian
manifolds which **expands the metric** (`|df_p(v)| ≥ |v|`), out of a **complete**
(proper) manifold `M`, onto a **simply connected** manifold `M'`. Then `f` is a
**diffeomorphism**.

Assembly: `f` is a covering map by Lemma 3.3
(`DCExpandsMetric.isCoveringMap`); a covering map onto a simply connected base is
bijective (`IsCoveringMap.bijective_of_simplyConnected`); a bijective local
diffeomorphism is a diffeomorphism (`IsLocalDiffeomorph.diffeomorphOfBijective`).

Applied to `f = exp_p : T_pM → M` (once `lem:dc-ch7-3-2` provides the
local-diffeomorphism input and the pulled-back metric makes `exp_p` a local
isometry out of the complete flat `T_pM`), this is exactly the Hadamard
conclusion. -/
