# Evans, Ch. 2 §2.2.3 Theorem 11 — Harnack's inequality (global form)

Evans, *Partial Differential Equations* (2nd ed.), §2.2.3 Theorem 11: for each
connected `V ⋐ U` there is a constant `C = C(V)` such that `sup_V u ≤ C · inf_V u`
for **all** nonnegative harmonic functions `u` on `U`.

Following the strategy of `EvansLib.Ch02.MeanValue`, we take the (solid-ball)
mean-value property `HasBallMeanValueProperty` as the working hypothesis — the
bridge `harmonic ⟹ MVP` (Evans Thm 2) is the one step still gated on the
divergence theorem for balls. The one-step comparison `u y ≤ 2ⁿ u x` for
`dist x y ≤ r`, `closedBall x (2r) ⊆ U` is `EvansLib.harnack_local`; this file
performs Evans's chain-of-balls argument:

* cover the compact set `closure V` by finitely many balls `B(zᵢ, r/2)` with
  centres `zᵢ ∈ closure V` (`IsCompact.finite_cover_balls`);
* form the intersection graph `ballChainGraph` on the centres — two centres are
  adjacent when their balls overlap *at a point of `V`* — and show by a clopen
  argument that preconnectedness of `V` makes every centre whose ball meets `V`
  reachable from every other one (`exists_reachable_center`);
* iterate `harnack_local` along a walk in this graph (`le_pow_mul_of_walk`);
  shortcutting the walk to a path bounds its length by `N := #centres`, giving
  `u x ≤ (2ⁿ)^N u y` for all `x, y ∈ V`.

Main result: `EvansLib.exists_harnack_const` — the constant `C` is produced
*before* the function `u` is quantified, so it depends only on `V` (and `U`, `n`)
as in Evans's statement.

/-- **Chain step.** If `V` is preconnected and covered by the `ρ`-balls centred at `Z`,
then from any centre `z₀` whose ball meets `V`, every point `y ∈ V` lies in the ball of
some centre reachable from `z₀` in the intersection graph. This is the "chain of
overlapping balls" existence in Evans's proof of Harnack's inequality, obtained here by
a clopen argument from preconnectedness. -/

/-- **Harnack's inequality** (`thm:harnacks-inequality`, Evans §2.2.3 Thm 11), for
functions with the ball mean-value property. For every preconnected bounded `V` whose
closure lies in the open set `U`, there is a constant `C > 0`, depending only on `V`
(not on `u`!), such that `u x ≤ C * u y` for all `x, y ∈ V` and all nonnegative
continuous `u` having the ball mean-value property on `U`. Equivalently
`sup_V u ≤ C · inf_V u`: the values of a nonnegative harmonic function on `V` are all
comparable. -/
