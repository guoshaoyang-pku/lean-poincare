# Smoothness of pullback of alternating maps along a continuous linear map

Mathlib knows that `f ↦ (ω ↦ ω.compContinuousLinearMap f)` is continuous
(`ContinuousAlternatingMap.continuous_compContinuousLinearMapCLM`), but not that it is smooth.
Smoothness is what a bundle of alternating maps needs for its coordinate changes, so we prove it
here.

The map is homogeneous of degree `card ι` in `f`, so it is *not* linear and the usual
`IsBoundedBilinearMap.contDiff` route does not apply. Instead we exhibit it as the restriction to
the diagonal of the continuous multilinear map
`ContinuousMultilinearMap.compContinuousLinearMapContinuousMultilinear`, which is smooth by
`ContinuousMultilinearMap.contDiff`. That multilinear map takes values in *multilinear* maps rather
than alternating ones, so we return to alternating maps along `alternatizeCLM`, a continuous-linear
packaging of `ContinuousMultilinearMap.alternatization`. On the diagonal alternatization is
multiplication by `(card ι)!` (`alternatizeCLM_toContinuousMultilinearMap`), which is where the
characteristic-zero hypothesis enters.

## Main results

* `ContinuousMultilinearMap.alternatizeCLM`: alternatization as a continuous linear map.
* `ContinuousAlternatingMap.contDiff_compContinuousLinearMapCLM`: the pullback of alternating maps
  along a continuous linear map is `C^n` in that linear map.

/-- The pullback of alternating maps along a continuous linear map, factored through
multilinear maps: restrict along the inclusion of alternating maps into multilinear maps, pull back
there, then alternatize. This equals `(card ι)! • compContinuousLinearMapCLM f`, see
`alternatizedCompCLM_eq`.

We deliberately keep this as a composite of maps between spaces of *bounded* maps rather than
bundling it as a continuous linear map on an operator space: operator norms do not chain when the
domain is itself an operator space, and `ContDiff.clm_comp` handles the composite directly. -/
