Chapter 2, "Riemannian Metrics", §3 "Methods for Constructing Riemannian
Metrics": the ambient tangent bundle restricted to a submanifold.

Lee's Proposition 2.16 is a statement about the bundle he writes `T M̃|_M`: for a
submanifold `M ⊆ M̃`, the ambient tangent bundle restricted to `M`, whose fibre
at `p ∈ M` is the *ambient* tangent space `T_p M̃` rather than `T_p M`.  This is
the bundle in which the splitting

  `T_p M̃ = T_p M ⊕ N_p M`

lives, and it is where the tangential and normal projections `π^⊤`, `π^⊥` are
defined.

In the formalization a submanifold is presented, as everywhere else in this
chapter, by a smooth immersion `F : M → M̃` (Lee's Lemma 2.11 and
`LeeLib.Ch02.pullbackMetric`).  Under that presentation `T M̃|_M` is exactly the
**pullback bundle** `F *ᵖ T M̃`, whose fibre at `p` is `T_{F p} M̃` — mathlib's
`Bundle.Pullback`, which is already a `ContMDiffVectorBundle`
(`ContMDiffVectorBundle.pullback`).

What is missing upstream, and what this file supplies, is that `T M̃|_M` is a
*Riemannian* bundle: the ambient metric `g̃` restricts to an inner product on each
fibre `T_{F p} M̃`, and does so smoothly in `p`.  That is
`ContMDiffRiemannianMetric.pullback`.  Fibrewise there is nothing to prove —
`(f *ᵖ E) p` is by definition `E (f p)`, so the inner product is literally the
ambient one — and the content is the smooth dependence on `p`: the ambient metric
read in a trivialization of `f *ᵖ E` at `p₀` is the ambient metric read in a
trivialization of `E` at `f p₀`, precomposed with `f`, a composite of smooth maps.

## How the fibrewise inner product is installed, and why it is done this way

The naive route — declaring `NormedAddCommGroup ((f *ᵖ E) x)` and
`InnerProductSpace ℝ ((f *ᵖ E) x)` directly, by transfer from `E (f x)` — is the
one mathlib explicitly warns against (`Bundle.RiemannianMetric.toCore`: "Do not
use this `Core` structure if the space you are interested in already has a norm
instance defined on it, otherwise this will create a second non-defeq norm
instance").  It was tried here and it does not work, for a reason worth recording
because it is invisible until the two halves are needed at once:

* `InnerProductSpace ℝ V` extends `NormedSpace ℝ V` and hence *carries* a
  `Module ℝ V`.  A transferred `InnerProductSpace ℝ ((f *ᵖ E) x)` therefore gives
  `Module ℝ ((f *ᵖ E) x)` a second path, alongside mathlib's `instModulePullback`.
* Nothing goes wrong until a `RiemannianBundle` is installed on the *ambient*
  bundle — which for `T M̃` is the only way to have a metric at all.  From that
  point `Module ℝ ((f *ᵖ E) x)` resolves through the transferred inner product,
  while `VectorBundle.pullback` supplies `VectorBundle ℝ F (f *ᵖ E)` over
  `instModulePullback`; the two are definitionally equal but not syntactically,
  so `VectorBundle ℝ F (f *ᵖ E)` stops synthesizing and Gram-Schmidt can no
  longer be run in the ambient fibres.  (Absent a `RiemannianBundle` it
  synthesizes fine, which is why the defect hid for so long.)

The fix is mathlib's own: `RiemannianBundle` takes the *existing* `Module` as an
input and builds the norm and inner product on top of it, so the `Module` reduct
of the resulting `InnerProductSpace` is the one it started from and no second
path is created.  Using it requires the pre-normed fibre structures that
`Bundle.RiemannianMetric` asks for — `TopologicalSpace`, `AddCommGroup`,
`Module`, `IsTopologicalAddGroup`, `ContinuousConstSMul` — and mathlib supplies
only the first and the third for a pullback.  The other three are added below.

`AddCommGroup` is the delicate one.  Adding it makes `AddCommMonoid ((f *ᵖ E) x)`
reachable two ways (mathlib's `instAddCommMonoidPullback`, and via the new
`AddCommGroup`), and `Bundle.RiemannianMetric` binds `AddCommGroup` *before*
`Module`, so it demands a `Module` over the `AddCommMonoid` reduct of the
`AddCommGroup` — which `instModulePullback`, sitting over
`instAddCommMonoidPullback`, does not provide.  Rather than leave two towers that
differ by a beta-reduction and hope typeclass resolution picks consistently, this
file retires mathlib's per-point pair and rebuilds a single coherent tower on top
of `Pullback.addCommGroup`.  Every pullback bundle in this development is
Riemannian, so its fibres are always groups and nothing is lost; the erasure is
persistent to modules importing this one, which is the reason it is called out
here rather than buried.

Two further implementation notes, both forced by upstream:

* `FiberBundle.pullback` and `VectorBundle.pullback` are keyed on a bundled map
  `f : K` for an arbitrary `[FunLike K B' B] [ContinuousMapClass K B' B]`.  That
  pattern does not unify when the bundle instances are sought as *arguments* of
  another class, so `ContMDiffMap`-specialized copies are declared below.
* `symm_pullback` needs `cast_heq`: trivializing `f *ᵖ E` over `x` and
  trivializing `E` over `f x` are the same operation, but `Trivialization.symm`
  carries a cast between `(f *ᵖ E) x` and `E (f x)`.

Everything is stated for a general Riemannian vector bundle `E → B` pulled back
along a smooth map `f : B' → B`, not just for `T M̃` and an immersion: nothing in
the argument uses either, and the extra generality costs nothing.

/-! ### Fibrewise structure on a pullback bundle

`(f *ᵖ E) x` is by definition `E (f x)`, so every fibrewise structure transfers.
mathlib declares `TopologicalSpace`, `AddCommMonoid` and `Module` this way; the
remaining three that `Bundle.RiemannianMetric` requires are added here.

The `AddCommMonoid` and `Module` instances are rebuilt rather than reused: see
the file header.  Retiring them is what keeps a single tower over each fibre. -/

/-- **The ambient metric makes `T M̃|_M` a Riemannian bundle** (Lee, §2.3): if `g`
is a smooth Riemannian metric on a vector bundle `E → B` and `f : B' → B` is
smooth, then `f *ᵖ E` carries the pulled-back metric `(f^* g)_x = g_{f x}`, again
smooth.

Fibrewise there is nothing to do: `(f *ᵖ E) x` *is* `E (f x)`, so `g (f x)` is
already a bilinear form on it, and symmetry, positive definiteness and
boundedness are those of `g` at `f x` verbatim.  The content is that the form
still varies smoothly with `x ∈ B'`: read in a trivialization of `f *ᵖ E` at
`x₀`, it is the metric of `E` read in the trivialization at `f x₀` and
precomposed with `f`, hence smooth as a composite.

Installing this as `RiemannianBundle (f *ᵖ E) := ⟨(g.pullback f).toRiemannianMetric⟩`
puts the inner product on the fibres and, by mathlib's own instance, an
`IsContMDiffRiemannianBundle IB' n F (f *ᵖ E)` alongside it — which is what lets
`LeeLib.Ch02.gramSchmidtFrame` run inside the ambient fibres.

When `f` is the inclusion of a submanifold `M ⊆ M̃`, this bundle is the *ambient
tangent bundle along `M`*, written `T M̃|_M`: the bundle in which the splitting
`T_p M̃ = T_p M ⊕ N_p M` and the projections `π^⊤`, `π^⊥` of Lee's Proposition
2.16 live. -/
