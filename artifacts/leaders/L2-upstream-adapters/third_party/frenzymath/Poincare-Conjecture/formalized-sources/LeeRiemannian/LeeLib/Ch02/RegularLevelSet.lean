Chapter 2, "Riemannian Metrics", §"Raising and Lowering Indices": **Proposition
2.37** — a regular level set of `f ∈ C^∞(M)` is an embedded hypersurface, and
`grad f` is everywhere normal to it.

Lee states the proposition for `M_c = f⁻¹(c) ∩ ℛ`, where `ℛ` is the set of
regular points of `f`.  The two halves are proved separately here:

* the **hypersurface structure** is `LevelSetChartedSpace.lean`
  (`levelSetChartedSpace`, `isManifold_levelSet`, `contMDiff_levelSet_val`) —
  Lee's Corollary A.26 in codimension one, whose global assembly the pinned
  mathlib does not have in any form;
* the **normality of `grad f`** is this file, and is where the Riemannian
  metric finally enters.

## What "normal" means here

Lee's `grad f|_p ⊥ T_p M_c` is, after the identification `T_p M_c = ker df_p`
(`range_mfderiv_levelSet_val`), the statement that `⟨grad f|_p, w⟩ = 0` for
every `w` in the range of the inclusion differential.  That is
`innerAt_grad_eq_zero_of_mem_ker` transported along the identification, which
is `innerAt_grad_mfderiv_levelSet_val_eq_zero` below.

The converse — every `g`-orthogonal direction to `grad f|_p` *is* tangent to
`M_c` — also holds and is proved here
(`exists_mfderiv_levelSet_val_eq_of_innerAt_grad_eq_zero`), so together the two
say that `T_p M_c` is exactly the `g`-orthogonal complement of `grad f|_p`:
the normal bundle of a regular level set is spanned by the gradient.  This is
the form Lee actually uses when he computes with hypersurfaces.

## Scope: regular value versus regular part

Everything below is stated for a **regular value** — `hreg` says `df_x ≠ 0` at
every point of `f⁻¹(c)` — rather than for Lee's `M_c = f⁻¹(c) ∩ ℛ`, which keeps
only the regular part of a possibly-critical level set.  `regularSet` (Lee's
`ℛ`) is defined here and characterised as the non-vanishing locus of `grad f`,
but the reduction of the general statement to the regular-value one is **not**
carried out: it needs `ℛ` to be open, which is not proved here.  See the note
at the bottom of the file for what that proof requires.

For every tangent vector `w` of the hypersurface `f ⁻¹' {c}` at `x₀`, the
gradient of `f` is `g`-orthogonal to the corresponding tangent vector
`dι(w) ∈ T_{x₀} M` of the ambient manifold.

This is Lee's assertion that `grad f` is everywhere normal to `M_c`.  Its
content is the identification `T_p M_c = ker df_p` (`range_mfderiv_levelSet_val`
supplies the harder inclusion, though only the easy one is needed here) plus
the pointwise fact `⟨grad f|_p, ·⟩ = df_p`. -/

Conversely to `innerAt_grad_mfderiv_levelSet_val_eq_zero`: every ambient
tangent vector at `x₀` that is `g`-orthogonal to `grad f|_{x₀}` *is* tangent to
the level set.  Together the two say that `T_{x₀} M_c` is precisely the
`g`-orthogonal complement of `grad f|_{x₀}` in `T_{x₀} M`, which is the
statement Lee's hypersurface computations use.

This direction is the one that needs the full strength of
`range_mfderiv_levelSet_val`: it is a dimension count, not a computation. -/

### Proposition 2.37 for a possibly-critical level set

Lee's `M_c = f⁻¹(c) ∩ ℛ` allows the level set to contain critical points, and
keeps only its regular part.  Everything above is stated for a *regular value*
(`hreg`: `df_x ≠ 0` at every point of `f⁻¹(c)`), which is the case Lee's own
proof reduces to and the case his applications use.

The reduction of the general statement to this one is carried out in
`RegularSetHypersurface.lean`, on top of the openness of `ℛ` proved here
(`isOpen_regularSet`): `ℛ` is an open submanifold of `M`, `M_c` is the level set
of `f|_ℛ` at `c`, and `c` is a regular value of that restriction *by
construction*, because restricting to an open set does not change the
differential.

Openness did not need the chart comparison an earlier note here called for:
rather than identify `df_x` with the derivative of a chart representative,
`isOpen_setOf_mfderiv_ne_zero` reads `x ↦ df_x` in *tangent* coordinates, where
mathlib's `ContMDiffAt.mfderiv_const` already supplies smoothness and the
trivialization equivalences make vanishing of the coordinate representation
equivalent to vanishing of `df_x`.

The remaining transfer needed `d(ℛ ↪ M) = id` for `ℛ` open in an *arbitrary*
manifold.  An earlier note here cited `OpenSubmanifold.lean` for that, but at the
time that file proved it only for an open subset of a normed space (the flat case
`W : Opens F` used by `PolarCoordinates.lean`); the general form has since been
added there (`mfderiv_opens_subtypeVal`, `mfderiv_opens_restrict`).
