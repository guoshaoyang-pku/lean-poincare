Chapter 2, "Riemannian Metrics", §"Riemannian Coverings", **Proposition 2.31**.

Lee: *let `π : M̃ → M` be a smooth normal covering map, and `g̃` any metric on `M̃`
that is invariant under all covering automorphisms.  Then there is a unique metric
`g` on `M` such that `π` is a Riemannian covering.*

## The route

Lee's proof is a short reduction to Theorem 2.28
(`existsUnique_isRiemannianSubmersion_metric`), and that is exactly how it is
formalized here.  The group acting on `M̃` is the covering automorphism group
`Aut_π(M̃)` (`CoveringAut`), and 2.28's four hypotheses are supplied by:

* **submersion** — a smooth covering map is a local diffeomorphism (Lee A.49(a)),
  so every `dπ_x` is a linear equivalence, in particular surjective;
* **vertical** — `π ∘ φ = π` is the defining property of a covering automorphism;
* **fibre-transitive** — this is exactly what normality buys (Lee C.21);
* **isometric** — the invariance hypothesis on `g̃`.

Theorem 2.28 then yields a unique `g` making `π` a Riemannian *submersion*, and the
last step upgrades that to a *local isometry*: `dπ_x` is not merely surjective but
bijective, so `V_x = ker dπ_x = 0`, hence `H_x = T_x M̃` and every tangent vector is
horizontal, which collapses the definition of a Riemannian submersion onto that of a
metric-preserving map.  `isRiemannianSubmersion_iff_isMetricPreserving` is that step.
It is stated as an *iff* precisely so that 2.28's *uniqueness* transfers as well:
without the converse direction one would obtain existence of `g` but could not rule
out a second metric making `π` a local isometry without making it a submersion.

## Two modelling decisions, and why they are faithful

**Smooth covering maps.**  Lee defines a smooth covering map by evenly covered
neighbourhoods whose sheets map *diffeomorphically* onto the base.  Mathlib has
`IsCoveringMap` (the topological notion) but nothing smooth — `IsCoveringMap` does
not occur anywhere under `Mathlib/Geometry/`.  Rather than rebuild the sheet-wise
definition, `IsSmoothCoveringMap` is spelled as "topological covering map *and*
local diffeomorphism", which is Lee's own Proposition A.49(c): *a topological
covering map is a smooth covering map if and only if it is a local diffeomorphism*.
Surjectivity is a separate field because Lee builds it into the definition of a
covering map while mathlib deliberately does not: `IsCoveringMap`'s docstring allows
empty fibres, and `IsCoveringMap.of_isEmpty` makes the empty map a covering map.

**Normality.**  Lee defines a normal covering by a condition on `π_*` of fundamental
groups, and Proposition C.21 says this holds *iff* `Aut_π(M̃)` acts transitively on
each fibre.  Proposition 2.31 uses normality only through that conclusion, and the
fundamental group of a manifold is not available here (Appendix C is unformalized),
so `IsNormalCovering` is spelled as the fibre-transitivity characterization.  This
is the C.21-equivalent of Lee's definition, not a weakening of the theorem.

/-! ## Smooth covering maps -/

/-- **A smooth covering map** (Lee, Appendix A): a surjective smooth map that is a
topological covering map and a local diffeomorphism.

By Lee's Proposition A.49(c) a topological covering map is a smooth covering map
exactly when it is a local diffeomorphism, so this is Lee's notion and not a
convenient approximation to it.  `surjective` is a field of its own because Lee's
covering maps are surjective by definition whereas mathlib's `IsCoveringMap` permits
empty fibres. -/

/-! ## Normal coverings and Riemannian coverings -/

/-- **A normal covering** (Lee, via Proposition C.21): one whose automorphism group
acts transitively on each fibre.

Lee's definition asks that `π_*(π₁(M̃))` be a normal subgroup of `π₁(M)`, and C.21
identifies that with the condition below; 2.31 uses normality only through C.21, and
fundamental groups of manifolds are not available here. -/

that is a local isometry.

Lee's "local isometry" is spelled here as `IsMetricPreserving`, i.e. `π^* g = g̃`.
The two agree for a covering map, which is in particular a local diffeomorphism, and
`IsRiemannianCovering.isLocalIsometry` below proves it — so this really is Lee's
definition and not a weakening of it. -/

exactly `IsLocalIsometry`.  No hypothesis on dimensions is needed here — unlike in
Lee's Exercise 2.7, the local diffeomorphism is given rather than deduced, so the
inverse function theorem does not enter. -/

Forwards: injectivity of `dπ_x` makes every tangent vector horizontal
(`horizontalSpace_eq_top`), so the defining condition of a Riemannian submersion —
which only constrains horizontal vectors — becomes the definition of `π^* g' = g`.
Backwards: `π^* g' = g` constrains *all* vectors, so it implies the horizontal
condition without any hypothesis on `dπ_x` beyond surjectivity. -/

The proof is Lee's.  `Aut_π(M̃)` acts on `M̃` isometrically (invariance), vertically
(`π ∘ φ = π`), and transitively on fibres (normality, via C.21); `π` is a surjective
submersion (A.49); so Theorem 2.28 gives a unique metric making `π` a Riemannian
submersion, and `isRiemannianSubmersion_iff_isMetricPreserving` identifies those
