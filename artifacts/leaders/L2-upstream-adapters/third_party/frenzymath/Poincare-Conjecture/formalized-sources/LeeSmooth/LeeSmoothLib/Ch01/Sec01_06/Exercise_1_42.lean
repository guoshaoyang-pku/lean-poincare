-- This exercise now reuses the earlier chapter owner `IsRegularCoordinateHalfBall` directly and
-- relates the new ball/half-ball statements to the boundary-model coordinate-ball API of
-- Proposition 1.40 instead of maintaining a parallel local vocabulary.

/-- A regular coordinate ball is a subset whose closure lies in the source of a smooth boundary
chart sending the subset to an open Euclidean ball, its closure to the corresponding closed ball,

hyperplane. This is the ball analogue of Definition 1.6-extra-3's regular coordinate half-balls.
