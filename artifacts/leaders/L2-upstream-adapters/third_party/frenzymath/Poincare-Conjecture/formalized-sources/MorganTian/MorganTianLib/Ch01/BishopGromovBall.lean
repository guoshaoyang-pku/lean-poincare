# Morgan–Tian Ch. 1, §1.4 — Bishop–Gromov for the volume of a ball

`BishopGromov.lean` proves the comparison-geometry core of `thm:bishop-gromov`: for a *single*
radial direction, the ratio of `∫₀ʳ ν(t) dt` to `∫₀ʳ sn_k^{n−1}(t) dt` is non-increasing
(`bishop_gromov_radial`). That is a statement about one geodesic. It says nothing about a
*volume*.

This file closes the gap between the two: it integrates the radial statement over the sphere of
directions and produces the **relative volume comparison of a ball**.

## What a "volume" is here

There is no Riemannian measure anywhere in this workspace (no density bundle, no partition of
unity — and mathlib has no area formula for a manifold). So `Vol B(p,r)` is not available as an
abstract measure of a subset of `M`.

It does not need to be. Morgan–Tian's own proof never touches an abstract measure either: it
*computes*

  `Vol B(p,r) = ∫_S ∫₀^{min(r, c(θ))} λ(t,θ) dt dθ`,

i.e. it pushes Lebesgue measure on `T_pM` forward through `exp_p` and integrates the Jacobian.
That integral over `T_pM` is what this file takes as the definition (`expBallVolume`), with the
density `ρ` extended by `0` past the cut time — which is precisely gap (c) of the status note in
`BishopGromov.lean`, and is free here because extension by zero is what "`ρ` is a function on all
of `T_pM`" already means.

So the theorem below is Bishop–Gromov for the honest object Morgan–Tian manipulate. What it does
*not* do is identify `expBallVolume` with `μ_g(B(p,r))` for an abstract Riemannian measure `μ_g`;
that identification is the change-of-variables/cut-locus-null step, and it cannot even be *stated*
until a Riemannian measure exists. See "Honest scope" below.

## The proof, and why it is not the blueprint's

The blueprint proof divides: it forms the ratio `h(t,θ) = λ(t,θ)/sn_k^{n-1}(t)`, argues it is
non-increasing in `t` for each `θ`, and averages. Division forces positivity and finiteness side
conditions everywhere, and in `ℝ≥0∞` (where volumes live) division is badly behaved.

Cross-multiplying removes all of it. The monotonicity of `r ↦ Vol(r)/V_k(r)` is, verbatim,

  `Vol(r₂) · V_k(r₁) ≤ Vol(r₁) · V_k(r₂)`   for `0 < r₁ ≤ r₂ < R`,

and in that form the proof is pure semiring algebra in `ℝ≥0∞` — no division, no subtraction, no
cancellation (which would need finiteness), and no positivity of the denominator:

* Split each integral at `r₁`: `Vol(r₂) = 𝐀 + 𝐁`, `V_k(r₂) = m·(C + D)`, `Vol(r₁) = 𝐀`,
  `V_k(r₁) = m·C`. Distributing, the claim reduces to `𝐁 · C ≤ 𝐀 · D`.
* `𝐁 · C ≤ 𝐀 · D` is proved *for each direction* `ω` and then integrated: pulling the constants
  `C`, `D` inside the `t`-integral turns both sides into double integrals over
  `(s,t) ∈ (r₁,r₂) × (0,r₁)`, whose integrands are `ν_ω(s)·g(t)` and `ν_ω(t)·g(s)`. Since `t < s`,
  the pointwise antitone-ratio hypothesis is *exactly* `ν_ω(s)·g(t) ≤ ν_ω(t)·g(s)`
  (`lintegral_cross_le`).
* The average over `θ` is then `lintegral_mono` — it costs one line, not a Fubini argument.

## Main results

* `lintegral_cross_le` — the `ℝ≥0∞` integral-ratio engine, cross-multiplied. This is the
  `ℝ≥0∞`, division-free counterpart of `antitoneOn_integral_ratio`.
* `modelBallVolume_eq` — an abstract chart-integral identity
  `ω_{n−1} · ∫₀ʳ sn_k^{n−1}`, retaining the reusable polar calculation without asserting a
  model-manifold measure identification,
  from `setLIntegral_ball_radial`.
* `bishop_gromov_ball` — the relative volume comparison, cross-multiplied.
* `bishop_gromov_ball_ratio` — the same as monotonicity of the ratio, under the extra finiteness
  and positivity needed to divide.

## Honest scope

The one thing still missing for blueprint `\leanok` on `thm:bishop-gromov` is the identification
of `expBallVolume` with the Riemannian measure of `B(p,r)` — i.e. that `exp_p` is a
measure-preserving-up-to-Jacobian diffeomorphism of the star-shaped domain `U_p` onto a full-measure
subset of `B(p,r)` (blueprint `lem:localized-cut-locus`, and the cut locus being null). That step
needs a Riemannian measure on `M`, which does not exist in this workspace. Gaps (a)-second-half,
(b), (c) and (d) of the `BishopGromov.lean` status note are closed here; gap (a)-first-half
(change of variables + cut locus) is not.

/-! ### Step 1 — the `ℝ≥0∞` integral-ratio engine, cross-multiplied -/

/-- **Math.** **The cross-multiplied integral-ratio engine, in `ℝ≥0∞`.**

Let `F, G : ℝ → ℝ≥0∞` be measurable and suppose that for every `t` in `(a,b)` and every `s` in
`(b,c)` — so `t < s` — one has the *cross* inequality `F s · G t ≤ F t · G s` (this is what
"`F/G` is non-increasing" says once the denominators are cleared). Then

  `(∫_{(b,c)} F) · (∫_{(a,b)} G) ≤ (∫_{(a,b)} F) · (∫_{(b,c)} G)`.

Proof: pull each constant factor inside the other integral. Both sides become the double integral
over `(s,t) ∈ (b,c) × (a,b)` of `F s · G t`, resp. `F t · G s`, and the hypothesis compares the
integrands pointwise.

Unlike `antitoneOn_integral_ratio`, this needs **no** positivity of `G`, **no** integrability, and
**no** finiteness: `ℝ≥0∞` is a complete ordered semiring, and only monotonicity of `∫⁻` and
distributivity are used. That is exactly what makes it usable for volumes.

/-! ### Step 3 — Bishop–Gromov for the ball -/

/-- The **polar volume density** in the direction `ω`: `ν_ω(t) = t^{n−1} · ρ(t·ω)`.

This is Morgan–Tian's `λ(t,θ)`. It is the integrand produced by polar-decomposing
`expBallVolume`, and (via the frame identification of `ComparisonMinimizing.lean`) it is
`polarDensity 𝒥` for the matrix Jacobi field `𝒥` along the radial geodesic `γ_ω`. -/
def polarBallDensity (ρ : E → ℝ) (ω : E) (t : ℝ) : ℝ :=
  t ^ (finrank ℝ E - 1) * ρ (t • ω)

/-- **Math.** **Bishop–Gromov relative volume comparison, cross-multiplied.**

Let `ρ ≥ 0` be the volume density of `exp_p` on `T_pM` (extended by `0` past the cut time), and
suppose that in every unit direction `ω` the polar density `ν_ω(t) = t^{n−1} ρ(t·ω)` has
non-increasing ratio to the model density `sn_k^{n−1}` on `(0,R)`. Then for `0 < r₁ ≤ r₂ < R`

  `Vρ(r₂) · Vk(r₁) ≤ Vρ(r₁) · Vk(r₂)`,

where `Vρ r = expBallVolume μ ρ r` and `Vk r = modelBallVolume μ k r`.  This is an
abstract chart-integral comparison; no model-manifold Riemannian measure is used here.

The hypothesis `hanti` is supplied, in each direction, by
`antitoneOn_polarDensity_div_snK_pow` (equivalently `bishop_gromov_radial`'s pointwise input) under
`Ric ≥ −(n−1)k`; that is the comparison geometry, and it is already proved. What this theorem adds
is the *integration over the sphere of directions*, which is where a volume — as opposed to a
density — first appears.

`bishop_gromov_ball` is the cross-multiplied inequality, which needs no side conditions. To read it
back as "the *ratio* `Vol B(p,r) / Vol B_{H^n_k}(q_k,r)` is a non-increasing function of `r`" — the
way `thm:bishop-gromov` is stated — the denominator has to be positive and finite. Both are true,
and are proved here rather than assumed: an unprovable side hypothesis would make the ratio form
vacuous. -/

/-! ### Step 5 — non-vacuity: the model density satisfies the hypotheses

A theorem whose hypotheses no caller can discharge is worthless, however green the build. The
hypothesis `hanti` of `bishop_gromov_ball` is a statement about the density `ρ`, so it is worth
exhibiting a `ρ` that satisfies it. The totalized comparison density
`ρ_k(v) = (sn_k(|v|)/|v|)^{n−1}` away from the origin does: its polar ratio is *identically* `1`,
so the abstract comparison degenerates to `expBallVolume/modelBallVolume ≡ 1`.

This also records the intended comparison density (without constructing a model-manifold measure).
For a general manifold, `ρ(v) = |det d(exp_p)_v|`, since
`d(exp_p)_{t·ω}(w) = J_w(t)/t` gives `|det d(exp_p)_{t·ω}| = det 𝒥_ω(t)/t^n`, whence
`polarBallDensity ρ ω t = t^{n−1}·ρ(t·ω) = det 𝒥_ω(t)/t = polarDensity 𝒥_ω t` — the density that
`antitoneOn_polarDensity_div_snK_pow` already controls. -/

/-- **Math.** **Non-vacuity of `bishop_gromov_ball`.** The totalized model density satisfies the
antitone polar-ratio hypothesis: away from the origin its polar density *equals* `sn_k^{n−1}`, so the ratio is
the constant `1`, which is (weakly) non-increasing. -/

dischargeable for the totalized comparison density itself. The conclusion is then the
