# Poincaré Ch. 1, §1.4 — smoothness of the chart reading, and a chart partition with slack

Two pieces of infrastructure needed by the broken second variation.

## (1) Smoothness of `chartVectorRep`

`chartVectorRep γ α J τ = tangentCoordChange I (γ τ) α (γ τ) (J τ)` is the reading, in the
chart at the fixed basepoint `α`, of a field `J` of tangent vectors carried along `γ` at their
own feet.  There is *no* unconditional regularity for it: the `E`-representative `J τ` of a
tangent vector at `γ τ` is taken in the **preferred chart at `γ τ`**, which jumps as `τ` moves,
so `J` alone carries no analytic information.  What *is* true — and is what every consumer
actually has — is that the readings in two charts differ by the derivative of the (smooth)
transition map at the moving foot:

  `chartVectorRep γ α J τ = Dτ_{βα}( x̂_β(τ) ) ( chartVectorRep γ β J τ )`,

by `tangentCoordChange_comp`.  Hence `contDiffOn_chartVectorRep`: **if the reading of the field
in one chart `β` is `C^n`, and the chart-`β` reading of the curve is `C^n`, and the curve stays
in both chart sources, then the reading in any other chart `α` is `C^n`.**  The analytic content
is `contDiffOn_fderiv_chartTransition`: the derivative of the chart transition is `C^∞` on the
(open) overlap, since the transition itself is (`contDiffOn_chartTransition`).

## (2) A chart partition with slack

`exists_geodesic_chart_partition` (`Ch01/ChartPartition.lean`) partitions `[0,1]` so that each
*closed* piece lands in one chart source.  The piece second-variation lemma
(`deriv_deriv_pieceEnergy_eq_integral_chartIndexIntegrand`) needs strictly more: an **open box**
`Ioo (-r) r ×ˢ Ioo (τᵢ - r) (τᵢ₊₁ + r)` mapping into an open `U ⊆ E` (openness is load-bearing
for the `C^∞` bootstrap and for `contDiffOn_succ_iff_deriv_of_isOpen`), and `τᵢ ≠ τᵢ₊₁` (which
`chartVariation` requires).  `exists_chart_partition_slack` produces a **strictly increasing**
partition together with a single slack radius `r > 0` such that even the *enlarged closed*
interval `[τᵢ - r, τᵢ₊₁ + r]` is carried by `γ` into the `i`-th chart source (hence its chart
image into the open chart target `U = (extChartAt I αᵢ).target`).  The engine is the Lebesgue
number of the open cover of the compact interval by the `γ`-preimages of the chart sources: a
uniform grid of mesh `< δ/4` with slack `δ/4` keeps every enlarged piece inside a `δ`-ball.

/-- **Math.** **Smoothness of the chart reading of a field along a curve.**
Let `J` be a field of tangent vectors along `γ` (each `J τ` an `E`-representative of a vector at
`γ τ`).  Its readings in two charts `β`, `α` containing the curve are related by the derivative
of the chart transition at the moving foot,
`chartVectorRep γ α J τ = Dτ_{βα}(φ_β(γ τ)) (chartVectorRep γ β J τ)`.
Since the transition derivative is `C^∞` on the overlap, the chart-`α` reading is as smooth as
the chart-`β` reading and the chart-`β` reading of the curve.

The hypotheses are exactly the data a consumer has: a chart `β` in which the field is *given*
(e.g. the solution of the chart Jacobi ODE, cf. `IsJacobiFieldOn` / `JacobiExistence`, whose
chart-`β` reading is literally that solution), the `C^n` chart reading of the geodesic, and the
fact that the piece of the curve lies in both chart sources.  No regularity of `J` itself is
assumed — none is available, since the `E`-representative of `J τ` is taken in the preferred
chart at `γ τ`, which jumps with `τ`. -/

/-! ### (2) The chart partition with slack -/

/-- **Math.** **Chart partition with slack.** Let `γ` be continuous on an open set `O ⊆ ℝ`
containing the compact interval `[a, b]`, `a < b` (in the application: a geodesic, continuous on
all of `ℝ`, and `[a, b]` the parameter interval of the variation).  Then there is a **strictly
increasing** uniform partition `a = τ 0 < τ 1 < ⋯ < τ N = b` of `[a, b]`, a choice of chart
centres `α i`, and a single **slack radius** `r > 0` such that for each piece `i < N` the
*enlarged closed* interval `[τ i - r, τ (i+1) + r]` still lies in `O` and is carried by `γ` into
the source of the chart at `α i` (hence its chart image lies in the chart target).

Strict monotonicity gives `τ i ≠ τ (i+1)` for free — the hypothesis `chartVariation` needs —
and the slack `r` gives the *open* box `Ioo (τ i - r) (τ (i+1) + r)` in the time direction
required by the piece second variation.

The proof is the Lebesgue number `δ` of the open cover of `[a, b]` by the `γ`-preimages
`O ∩ γ⁻¹((chartAt H x).source)` of the chart sources: a uniform grid of mesh `(b - a)/N < δ/4`
with slack `r = δ/4` keeps every enlarged piece `[τ i - r, τ (i+1) + r]` inside the `δ`-ball
around `τ i`, hence inside one member of the cover. -/
