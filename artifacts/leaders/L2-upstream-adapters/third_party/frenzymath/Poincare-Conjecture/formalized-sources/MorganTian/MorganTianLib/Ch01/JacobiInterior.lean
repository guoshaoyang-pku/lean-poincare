# Poincaré Ch. 1, §1.4 — Jacobi fields with data prescribed at an *interior* time

Every existence/uniqueness statement for Jacobi fields in this development prescribes the
data `(J, ∇J)` at the **left endpoint** of the interval: `exists_isJacobiFieldAlongOn` builds
the field on `[a, b]` from `(J a, ∇J a)`, and `IsJacobiFieldAlongOn.eqOn_zero` propagates
vanishing rightwards from `a`.

That is not enough for the comparison theory. The radial Jacobi datum of
`exists_isRadialJacobi_of_geodesic_velocity` — the input to `sectional_curvature_comparison`
and `ricci_curvature_comparison` — is stated for a geodesic on `[a, b]` with `a < 0 < B < b`,
so that every time of `[0, B]` is *interior* (the chart pair system is a two-sided ODE, and
one-sided derivatives at `0` would not do). Its column clause

  `frameVec J t = 𝒥 t (frameVec ∇J 0)`   for every Jacobi field `J` on `[a, b]` with `J 0 = 0`

therefore quantifies over Jacobi fields on the *large* interval `[a, b]`, while the field one
actually wants to build is pinned by its data at the interior time `0`. Left-endpoint
existence cannot produce it.

This file closes that gap.

## The two results

* `IsJacobiFieldAlongOn.eqOn_zero_of_mem` — **two-sided uniqueness**: a Jacobi field vanishing
  to first order at *any* `c ∈ [a, b]` vanishes identically on `[a, b]`.
* `exists_isJacobiFieldAlongOn_mem` — **interior-data existence**: for any `c ∈ [a, b]` and any
  `(J₀, D₀)` in `T_{γc}M`, there is a Jacobi field on all of `[a, b]` with `J c = J₀`,
  `∇J c = D₀`.

## Why uniqueness is a *clopen* argument, not a walk

`IsJacobiFieldAlongOn.eqOn_zero` propagates vanishing from `a` by a supremum walk. One cannot
simply run that walk backwards from an interior `c`, and — more importantly — the obvious
"the vanishing set is closed because `J` is continuous" step is **false here**: `J t : E` is
the reading of `J` in the chart *at its own foot* `γ t`, so `t ↦ J t` genuinely jumps whenever
the chart changes. It is not a continuous `ℝ → E`.

The fix is that we never need closedness from continuity. In the chart window `[a', b']`
supplied by `IsJacobiFieldAlongOn` at a time `t₀`, the chart readings satisfy a linear ODE,
which has uniqueness in *both* time directions (`IsJacobiFieldOn.eqOn_of_left` and
`eqOn_of_right`). Hence:

  if the pair vanishes at even one point of the window, it vanishes on the whole window.

So the vanishing set `Z` meets a window only by containing it: `Z` is open in `[a, b]`, and its
complement is open too (a window around a non-vanishing time can contain no point of `Z`, else
the window rule would force vanishing at that time). `Z` is clopen and nonempty in the
connected `[a, b]`, so `Z = [a, b]`. No continuity of `J` is used anywhere.

## Existence from uniqueness

With two-sided uniqueness in hand, existence at an interior time is linear algebra. The
"data at `a` ↦ data at `c`" map `T : E × E → E × E` is

* well defined — left-endpoint existence plus `eqOn_of_initial`;
* linear — superposition (`IsJacobiFieldAlongOn.add`, `.smul`);
* injective — by `eqOn_zero_of_mem`: data `0` at `c` forces the field to vanish, in particular
  at `a`.

`E × E` is finite-dimensional, so `T` is surjective: some data at `a` produces the prescribed
data at `c`. This is the standard "the solution operator of a linear ODE is invertible"
argument, done at the manifold level so that no chart bookkeeping leaks out.

/-! ### Chart level: vanishing at one time of the window kills the window -/

/-- **Math.** **Two-sided vanishing for the chart pair system.** A chart Jacobi field that
vanishes to first order at *any* `c ∈ [a, b]` vanishes on all of `[a, b]`.

Forward from `c` this is `eqOn_of_left` against the zero solution; backward from `c` it is
`eqOn_of_right` against the zero solution. The linear ODE has uniqueness in both time
directions, which is what makes an interior time as good as an endpoint. -/

/-! ### Manifold level: two-sided uniqueness -/

/-- **Math.** **A Jacobi field vanishing to first order at *any* time vanishes identically.**
`IsJacobiFieldAlongOn.eqOn_zero` is the special case `c = a`.

The proof is a connectedness argument, not a walk. Around each `t₀ ∈ [a, b]` the definition of
`IsJacobiFieldAlongOn` supplies a chart window on which the chart readings solve a linear ODE;
by `IsJacobiFieldOn.eqOn_zero_of_mem` (two-sided uniqueness) the pair vanishes on the *whole*
window as soon as it vanishes at one of its times. So the vanishing set meets a window only by
swallowing it: both it and its complement are open in `[a, b]`. Since `[a, b]` is preconnected
and `c` lies in the vanishing set, that set is all of `[a, b]`.

Note that one may **not** argue "the vanishing set is closed because `J` is continuous": `J t`
is the reading of `J` in the chart at its own foot `γ t`, so `t ↦ J t` jumps at every change of
chart and is not a continuous map `ℝ → E`. The clopen argument above never differentiates or
takes limits of `J`, and so is insensitive to those jumps.

/-! ### Interior-data existence -/

/-- **Math.** **A Jacobi field may be prescribed at any time of the interval, not just at the
left endpoint.** For `c ∈ [a, b]` and any `(J₀, D₀) ∈ T_{γc}M × T_{γc}M` there is a Jacobi field
on *all* of `[a, b]` with `J c = J₀` and `∇J c = D₀`.

This is what lets one feed the column clause of `exists_isRadialJacobi_of_geodesic_velocity` —
which quantifies over Jacobi fields on the large interval `[a, b]`, `a < 0 < B < b` — with a
field pinned by its data at the *interior* centre `0`. `exists_isJacobiFieldAlongOn` alone
cannot do this: it only prescribes at `a`.

The proof is the invertibility of the solution operator of a linear ODE. The map
`Φ : (J a, ∇J a) ↦ (J c, ∇J c)` is linear by superposition and injective by
`eqOn_zero_of_mem` (data `0` at `c` forces the field, hence its data at `a`, to vanish); as an
injective endomorphism of the finite-dimensional space `E × E` it is surjective, so some datum
at `a` produces the prescribed datum at `c`.
