# Morgan–Tian Ch. 1, §1.4 — null sets for the Riemannian measure

Mathlib has **no** notion of a null set on a manifold: there is no `MeasureZero` predicate under
`Geometry/Manifold`, no chart-invariance lemma, and no Sard theorem beyond the equidimensional case
in `Jacobian.lean`. So the two facts every volume argument needs have to be built here:

* `riemannianMeasure_eq_zero_of_chartImage_null` — a subset of a single chart whose *coordinate
  image* is Lebesgue-null is `μ_g`-null. This is what makes "null" a chart-independent notion: the
  Riemannian measure is `√(det gᵢⱼ) · dx` in any chart, and a density cannot resurrect a null set.

* `riemannianMeasure_image_eq_zero_of_null` — the image of a Lebesgue-null set under a map
  `f : E → M` that is **differentiable read in charts** is `μ_g`-null. Downstream this is applied to
  `f = exp_p` (`riemannianMeasure_expMapGlobal_image_eq_zero`), which is exactly what turns nullity
  of the *cut vectors* in `T_pM` into nullity of the *cut locus* in `M`.

The proof of the second is mathlib's `addHaar_image_eq_zero_of_differentiableOn_of_addHaar_eq_zero`
("a differentiable map sends null sets to null sets", between finite-dimensional spaces), applied
chart by chart along the countable atlas `chartCover` that `riemannianMeasure` is built from. It is
the pointwise differentiability of `exp_p` in an *arbitrary* chart — `ExpChartDifferentiable` — that
lets the chart be chosen to suit the atlas rather than the Jacobi machinery.

Note neither statement needs `f '' N` to be measurable. Measures in mathlib are outer measures, and
nullity is proved by exhibiting a measurable null superset, which the chart argument produces.

/-! ## Nullity is a chart-local, chart-independent notion -/

/-- **Math.** **A set with null coordinate image is null.** If `A` lies inside a single chart and its
image `extChartAt α '' A` is Lebesgue-null in `E`, then `μ_g A = 0`.

`A` need not be measurable: we produce a measurable null superset. Take a measurable
`Z ⊇ extChartAt α '' A` with `μ Z = 0`; then `Zhat = (extChartAt α)⁻¹(Z) ∩ source` is a measurable
superset of `A` inside the chart whose coordinate image is `Z ∩ target`, and
`riemannianMeasure_apply_chart` computes `μ_g Zhat` as an integral over that null set. -/

/-- **Math.** **A chart-differentiable map sends null sets to null sets.**

Let `f : E → M` be continuous and, read in *any* chart around `f v`, differentiable at `v`. Then
`μ_g (f '' N) = 0` for every Lebesgue-null `N ⊆ E`.

Chart by chart along the countable atlas of `riemannianMeasure`: on the piece of `f '' N` lying in
the `α`-chart, the coordinate image is contained in the image of `N ∩ f⁻¹(source α)` under the
`E → E` map `extChartAt α ∘ f`, which is differentiable there — so mathlib's
`addHaar_image_eq_zero_of_differentiableOn_of_addHaar_eq_zero` applies. -/
