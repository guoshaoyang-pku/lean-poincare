# Poincaré Ch. 1, §1.3 — parallel transport is an isometry; parallel frames

`ParallelAlong` produced parallel transport along a geodesic crossing
arbitrarily many charts.  This file proves the property that makes it useful
for comparison geometry: **parallel transport preserves the metric**.  Hence a
frame that starts orthonormal at `γ a` stays orthonormal all along `γ`, which
is exactly the identification `T_{γ(t)}M ≅ E` (isometric, and turning `∇_{γ'}`
into `d/dt`) under which the Jacobi equation becomes the matrix ODE
`𝒥'' + ℛ𝒥 = 0` consumed by `IsRadialJacobi`.

Main results:

* `eqOn_const_of_locally_const` — a real function that is constant near every
  point of `[a, b]` (relatively) is constant on `[a, b]`.  This is how a
  chart-local invariant is upgraded to a global one along a curve leaving every
  chart: no supremum walk is needed once the local statement is available at
  *every* point, because a locally constant function on an interval is
  constant.
* `IsParallelAlongOn.metricInner_eq` — **parallel transport is an isometry**:
  `⟨V(t), W(t)⟩_{g,γ(t)}` is constant in `t` for `V, W` parallel along `γ`.
* `exists_parallelFrameAlong` — **a parallel frame along a geodesic**, with
  arbitrarily prescribed initial vectors, whose Gram matrix is constant; in
  particular an initially orthonormal frame stays orthonormal.

/-! ### Local constancy upgrades to global constancy -/

/-- **Math.** A real function that is constant on a relative neighbourhood of
every point of `[a, b]` is constant on `[a, b]`.

This is the mechanism by which a *chart-local* invariant becomes a *global*
invariant along a curve that leaves every chart: local constancy gives
continuity on `[a, b]` and a vanishing derivative at every interior point, and
a continuous function on an interval with vanishing interior derivative is
constant. -/

/-- **Math.** **Parallel transport is an isometry.**  If `V` and `W` are
parallel along the geodesic `γ` on `[a, b]`, then their metric inner product
`⟨V(t), W(t)⟩_{g, γ(t)}` is constant in `t`.

Proof: around any time `t₀` the curve stays in the chart at `γ t₀`, so both
fields localize there (`IsParallelAlongOn.isParallelSolOn_of_mem_source`), and
the chart computation `IsParallelSolOn.chartMetricInner_eq` shows the chart
Gram pairing — which is the intrinsic pairing, by
`metricInner_eq_chartMetricInner_rep` — is constant on that piece.  So the
intrinsic pairing is locally constant on `[a, b]`, hence constant.

/-! ### Parallel frames along a geodesic -/

/-- **Math.** **A parallel frame along a geodesic** (Morgan–Tian §1.3;
`lem:parallel-frame`).  Along a geodesic `γ` on `[a, b]` — which may cross
arbitrarily many charts — every family `e₀ : ι → T_{γ(a)}M` of initial vectors
extends to a family of fields parallel along `γ`, and the Gram matrix of the
family is **constant** along the curve.

In particular a family that is orthonormal at `γ a` is orthonormal at every
`γ t`: parallel transport supplies the isometric identification
`T_{γ(t)}M ≅ T_{γ(a)}M` under which `∇_{γ'}` becomes `d/dt`.  This is the
frame in which the Jacobi equation `∇²J + ℛ(J, γ')γ' = 0` turns into the
constant-coefficient-free matrix ODE `𝒥'' + ℛ𝒥 = 0` of `IsRadialJacobi`.
