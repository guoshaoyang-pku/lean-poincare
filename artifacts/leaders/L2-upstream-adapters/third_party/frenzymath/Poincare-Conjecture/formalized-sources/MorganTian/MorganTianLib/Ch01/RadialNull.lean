# Morgan–Tian Ch. 1, §1.5 — radial graphs are null

A **radial graph** in a finite-dimensional real normed space `E` is a set that meets every ray from
the origin in *at most one point*. The one fact proved here is that such a set is Lebesgue-null:

  `addHaar_eq_zero_of_pairwise_ray_eq` :
    `MeasurableSet A → (0 : E) ∉ A → (each ray meets `A` at most once) → μ A = 0`.

**Why this file exists.** The cut locus `C_p` of a complete Riemannian manifold is the `exp_p`-image
of the set of *cut vectors* `{c(u)·u : |u|_g = 1, c(u) < ∞}` — the radial boundary of the star-shaped
segment domain `U_p`. That set meets each ray from the origin exactly once (the cut time is the
*first* time the radial geodesic stops minimizing), so it is a radial graph, and this file shows it
is null. Composing with "a differentiable image of a null set is null" (`Ch01/MeasureNull.lean`)
gives `μ_g(C_p) = 0` — blueprint `lem:cut-locus-properties`(3).

**This route replaces the blueprint's argument.** The blueprint proves nullity of `C_p` from
`lem:localized-cut-locus`(4), whose proof invokes Sard's theorem ("the set of critical values has
measure zero"). Mathlib has no general Sard theorem, and the equidimensional case it *does* have
would still leave the second family (points joined to `p` by two minimizing geodesics) unhandled.
The radial-graph argument needs neither: it is Fubini in polar coordinates, and it does not even
need the cut time to be continuous — only measurable. It is also strictly stronger in the sense that
it never mentions conjugate points.

**The proof.** Mathlib's polar decomposition `Measure.measurePreserving_homeomorphUnitSphereProd`
identifies the Haar measure of `E ∖ {0}` with `μ.toSphere.prod (volumeIoiPow (n-1))` along
`v ↦ (‖v‖⁻¹ • v, ‖v‖)`. Under that identification a radial graph becomes a set whose every slice
over a direction `u` is a subsingleton in the radial variable, and the radial factor is atomless.
Fubini (`measure_prod_null_of_ae_null`) finishes.

/-! ## The radial factor is atomless -/

/-- **Math.** The radial factor `r^{n-1} dr` of the polar decomposition has no atoms: it is
absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure on `(0,∞)`, which has none.

Mathlib registers no `NullSingletonClass` instance for `volumeIoiPow`, so we supply it. -/

/-! ## Radial graphs -/

/-- **Math.** A **radial graph**: a set meeting every ray from the origin in at most one point.

The hypothesis is stated for the *rays through unit vectors*, `{r • u : r > 0}` with `‖u‖ = 1`,
which is exactly the parameterisation mathlib's polar decomposition uses. -/
def IsRadialGraph (A : Set E) : Prop :=
  ∀ u ∈ sphere (0 : E) 1, ∀ r₁ r₂ : ℝ, 0 < r₁ → 0 < r₂ → r₁ • u ∈ A → r₂ • u ∈ A → r₁ = r₂

/-- **Math.** **A measurable radial graph is Lebesgue-null.**

This is the polar-coordinate Fubini theorem: in polar coordinates the set is a graph over the
sphere, each of whose radial slices is a single point, and a point has no radial mass. -/
