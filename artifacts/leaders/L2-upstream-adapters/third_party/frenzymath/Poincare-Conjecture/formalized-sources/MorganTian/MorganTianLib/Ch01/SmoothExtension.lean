# Poincaré Ch. 1 — extending locally-smooth curve data to all of `ℝ`

The broken-variation machinery of `prop:minimal-geodesic-no-conjugate` is stated
for data that is `ContDiff` on **all** of `ℝ`: `MorganTianLib.contDiff_chartVariation`
wants `ContDiff ℝ n ŷ`, `ContDiff ℝ n Ŷ`, `ContDiff ℝ n ĉ₀`, `ContDiff ℝ n ĉ₁`, and
`MorganTianLib.deriv_deriv_pieceEnergy_eq_integral_chartIndexIntegrand` wants
`ContDiff ℝ 3 u` on the whole parameter plane.

The actual data is never global: the chart reading of a geodesic is smooth only
where the geodesic stays in the chart source
(`MorganTianLib.contDiffOn_chartReading_of_isGeodesicOn`), which is an open interval,
not `ℝ`.  This file closes that gap once, for one-variable data, with the standard
bump cut-off:

* `exists_contDiff_eqOn_of_contDiffOn_Ioo` — if `f` is `C^n` on `Ioo a b` and
  `[c, d] ⊆ (a, b)`, there is a **globally** `C^n` function `F` agreeing with `f`
  on an **open neighbourhood** `V` of `[c, d]` with `V ⊆ (a, b)`.

The neighbourhood, not merely `[c, d]` itself, is the point: the consumers
differentiate the data, and `fderiv`/`deriv` at a point only see a neighbourhood,
so `EqOn F f (Icc c d)` alone would be useless (it would not give
`deriv F = deriv f` even at interior points, let alone at `c` and `d`).

*Construction.*  Let `m = (c + d)/2` and `h = (d − c)/2`, so `[c, d]` is the closed
ball `closedBall m h`.  Take `ε = min (c − a) (b − d) > 0` and the `ContDiffBump`
at `m` with `rIn = h + ε/3` and `rOut = h + 2ε/3`.  It is `1` on `closedBall m rIn
⊇ [c, d]`, and its topological support is `closedBall m rOut ⊆ (a, b)`.  Put
`F = χ · f` on `(a, b)` and `F = 0` elsewhere.  On the open set `(a, b)` this is
`χ · f`, which is `C^n`; on the open set `(tsupport χ)ᶜ` it is identically `0`; and
these two open sets cover `ℝ` precisely because `tsupport χ ⊆ (a, b)`.  Finally `F`
agrees with `f` on the open ball `V = ball m rIn ∋ [c, d]`, where `χ = 1`.

Blueprint: `prop:minimal-geodesic-no-conjugate`.

/-- **Math.** **Locally-smooth curve data extends to globally-smooth curve data.**
If `f : ℝ → E` is `C^n` on the open interval `(a, b)` and `[c, d] ⊆ (a, b)`, then
there are a globally `C^n` function `F : ℝ → E` and an **open** set `V` with
`[c, d] ⊆ V ⊆ (a, b)` on which `F` and `f` agree.

Because `V` is open, every derivative of `F` on `V` — of any order, and in
particular the ones the second-variation machinery takes — coincides with the
corresponding derivative of `f`.  So a result proved for the global `F` transfers
verbatim to the local `f` on `[c, d]`.

This is what lets the genuinely-local chart data of a geodesic (smooth only where
the geodesic stays in one chart) be fed to `MorganTianLib.chartVariation` and to
`MorganTianLib.deriv_deriv_pieceEnergy_eq_integral_chartIndexIntegrand`, both of
which demand `ContDiff` on all of `ℝ`. -/
