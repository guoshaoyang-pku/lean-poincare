# Poincaré Ch. 2, §2.1/2.4 — Minimizing lines from two ends

The second half of Morgan–Tian's lemma "non-compact manifolds have ends" (blueprint
`lem:ends-exist`), in its metric form: a proper metric space with minimizing segments and
two distinct ends contains a unit-speed minimizing geodesic line, i.e. a map `γ : ℝ → M`
with `dist (γ s) (γ t) = |s - t|` for all `s, t : ℝ`.

## Main declarations

* `ConnectedComponents.mk_eq_mk_iff_connectedComponentIn_eq`: two points of a set `F` have
  the same class in `ConnectedComponents F` (the quotient of the subtype) iff their
  connected components in `F` (`connectedComponentIn`, subsets of the ambient space)
  coincide.
* `disjoint_connectedComponentIn_of_mk_ne_mk`: points of `F` in distinct classes have
  disjoint connected components in `F`.
* `IsPreconnected.exists_notMem_of_notMem_connectedComponentIn`: a map continuous on a
  preconnected set, whose value at one point escapes the component in `F` of its value at
  another point, must leave `F` somewhere.
* `SpaceOfEnds.exists_apply_ne`: distinct ends select distinct components of `X \ K` for
  some compact `K`.
* `SpaceOfEnds.exists_mem_connectedComponentIn_forall_le_dist`: **ends reach infinity** —
  in a proper metric space, the component of `M \ K` selected by an end contains points
  arbitrarily far from `K`.
* `exists_isMinGeodesicOn_univ_of_ends_ne`: the main result (blueprint `lem:ends-exist`,
  second half) — a proper metric space with minimizing segments and two distinct ends
  contains a unit-speed minimizing geodesic line.

## Design notes

* Two views of `π₀(M \ K)` coexist: the space of ends packages components as classes in the
  quotient `ConnectedComponents ((K : Set X)ᶜ)` of the subtype, while the geometric
  arguments (disjointness, crossing, unboundedness) are naturally about the subsets
  `connectedComponentIn ((K : Set X)ᶜ) x` of the ambient space. The bridge is
  `ConnectedComponents.mk_eq_mk_iff_connectedComponentIn_eq`, obtained from mathlib's
  `connectedComponentIn_eq_image` and the injectivity of `Subtype.val`.
* "Ends reach infinity" is Morgan–Tian's observation that each complementary component `U`
  recorded by an end contains points arbitrarily far from `K`: otherwise `U` would be
  bounded, `closure U` compact by properness, and the component the same end selects beyond
  the larger compact set `K ∪ closure U` would have to lie inside `U` yet outside
  `closure U` — a contradiction.
* The line is produced by `exists_isMinGeodesicOn_hyperfilter_limit`: minimizing segments
  `σ k` between points of the two components at distance `≥ k + 1` from `K` must cross `K`
  at some time `t₀ k` (their images are connected, and the two components are disjoint);
  recentering each segment at its crossing time yields minimizing geodesics on windows
  containing `[-(k+1), k+1]`, anchored in the compact set `K`, and the ultrafilter limit is
  a minimizing geodesic on all of `ℝ`.
