# Morgan–Tian Ch. 2, §2.6 — Forward difference quotients

The comparison lemma for forward difference quotients: a continuous function
`f` whose forward (upper right Dini) difference quotient satisfies
`df/dt (t) ≤ ψ(t, f(t))` on `[a, b)` is dominated on `[a, b]` by any solution
`G` of the ODE `G' = ψ(t, G)` with `f a ≤ G a`, provided `ψ` is `C¹` on the
strip `[a, b] × ℝ` (`le_of_forwardDiffQuotientLE`). Building on it, the
product case of Morgan–Tian's "forward difference maximum property": the
maximum `F_max(t) = ⨆ x, F x t` of a compact family is continuous
(`continuous_iSup_of_compact`), has forward difference quotient controlled by
the time derivative at maximizers (`forwardDiffQuotientLE_iSup`), and hence is
dominated by solutions of `G' = ψ(t, G)` (`iSup_le_of_forwardDiff_max`).

## Design notes

* `ForwardDiffQuotientLE f t c` encodes "the forward difference quotient of
  `f` at `t` is at most `c`", i.e. `limsup_{Δt → 0⁺} (f (t+Δt) - f t)/Δt ≤ c`,
  in the robust eventual form: for every `r > c`, eventually
  `slope f t z < r` as `z → t⁺`. This avoids junk values of `limsup` for
  quotients that are unbounded near `t` and plugs directly into the
  one-dimensional fencing lemmas of `Mathlib.Analysis.Calculus.MeanValue`.
* The proof of the comparison lemma is the classical barrier argument: for
  `ε > 0` small, fence `f` by `B_ε t = G t + ε · exp (2K(t - a))`, where `K`
  is a Lipschitz constant of `ψ` in its second variable on a compact strip
  containing the graphs of `f` and `G`; at a contact point `f x = B_ε x` the
  strict inequality `ψ x (f x) < B_ε' x` holds, so
  `image_le_of_liminf_slope_right_lt_deriv_boundary'` applies. Let `ε → 0⁺`.

/-- The **forward difference quotient** of `f : ℝ → ℝ` at `t` is **at most** `c`:
for every `r > c`, the right slopes `(f z - f t) / (z - t)` are eventually `< r`

/-! ### The maximum over a compact family

The product-case core of Morgan–Tian's "forward difference maximum property":
for a family `F : X → ℝ → ℝ` over a compact space `X`, the maximum function
`u(s) = ⨆ x, F x s` is continuous, its forward difference quotient at `t` is
controlled by the time derivative `F' x t` at the maximizers `x` of `F · t`,
and consequently `u` is dominated by any solution of `G' = ψ(t, G)` dominating
it initially. This is the case of the general statement (for a vector field
`χ` on a manifold with `χ(t) = 1`) obtained by trivializing along the flow of
`χ`; it is the form used for Ricci flow on compact manifolds. -/
