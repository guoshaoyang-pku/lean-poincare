# Strict differentiability on an open set gives `C¹`

A classical fact of differential calculus missing from mathlib: if `f` has a
**strict** Fréchet derivative at every point of an open set, then the
derivative assignment is continuous there, so `f` is `C¹` on the set.

The pointwise statement is sharper: continuity of the derivative map at `a`
needs strictness only **at** `a`, plus plain differentiability (with the given
derivative) at nearby points. The proof is the textbook estimate: the strict
little-o at `a` controls difference quotients *uniformly* for base points `b`
near `a`, and the plain derivative at `b` identifies those quotients with
`f' b`, giving `‖f' b - f' a‖ ≤ ε`.

Main declarations:

* `HasStrictFDerivAt.continuousAt_derivMap` — strictness at `a` + plain
  differentiability near `a` makes the derivative map continuous at `a`.
* `contDiffOn_one_of_hasStrictFDerivAt` — a map with a strict derivative at
  every point of an open set is `C¹` there.

These feed the `C¹` regularity of the gradient flow (`FlowIsometryLocal`,
`FlowC1`): the variational-equation machinery of `FlowVariation` produces
strict derivatives of the local flow at every point of the flow ball, and this
file upgrades that to genuine `C¹` dependence on the initial condition.

/-- **Math.** **Strict differentiability at a point makes the derivative map
continuous there**: if `f` has the strict Fréchet derivative `f' a` at `a` and
plain Fréchet derivative `f' b` at every `b` near `a`, then `f'` is continuous
at `a`. The strict little-o at `a` bounds the difference quotients of `f`
uniformly over base points near `a`; the pointwise derivative identifies those
quotients with `f' b`. -/
