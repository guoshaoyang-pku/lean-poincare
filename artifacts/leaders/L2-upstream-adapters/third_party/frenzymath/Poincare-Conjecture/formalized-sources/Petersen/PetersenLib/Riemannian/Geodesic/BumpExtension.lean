# Global `C^∞` extension of a `ContDiffOn` field by a bump multiplier

The abstract `C^∞` dependence of an ODE flow on its initial condition
(`PetersenLib.FlowDependence.contDiffAt_flow_of_picardResidual`) is stated for a field that is
`C^∞` **globally** on the whole Banach space, because its proof runs the `C^∞` Nemytskii /
superposition operator (`contDiff_superposition_infty`) over arbitrary curves. The geodesic spray,
however, is only `ContDiffOn ℝ ∞` on the chart region. This file bridges the gap with the classical
*multiply by a bump* extension: a field that is `C^∞` on an open set `U` is modified to a globally
`C^∞` field agreeing with it on a closed ball around any interior point.

* `exists_contDiff_eqOn_closedBall_of_contDiffOn` — given `F` with `ContDiffOn ℝ ∞ F U` on an open
  `U` and `z₀ ∈ U`, there are a radius `a > 0` with `closedBall z₀ a ⊆ U` and a globally `C^∞`
  field `F'` with `F' = F` on `closedBall z₀ a`.

`F'` is `ρ • F`, where `ρ` is a `ContDiffBump` centred at `z₀` equal to `1` on `closedBall z₀ a`
and with `tsupport ρ ⊆ U`. On `U` the product `ρ • F` is `C^∞`; off `tsupport ρ` it vanishes
identically, so it is `C^∞` there too, and the two open regions cover the space. Since the ODE
trajectories we care about stay inside `closedBall z₀ a`, the extended field has the *same flow* as
the original there, while being amenable to the global-smoothness machinery.

/-- **Math.** **Global `C^∞` extension of a locally `C^∞` field.** If `F` is `C^∞` on an open set
`U` and `z₀ ∈ U`, there are a radius `a > 0` with `closedBall z₀ a ⊆ U` and a globally `C^∞` field
`F'` agreeing with `F` on `closedBall z₀ a`. The extension is `ρ • F` for a bump `ρ` centred at
`z₀`, equal to `1` on `closedBall z₀ a` and supported inside `U`; it is `C^∞` because it equals the
`C^∞` product `ρ • F` on `U` and equals `0` off the (closed) support of `ρ`. -/
