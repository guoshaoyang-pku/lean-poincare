# Hopf–Rinow theorem (do Carmo Ch. 7, §2)

do Carmo, *Riemannian Geometry*, Ch. 7, Theorem 2.8: on a connected Riemannian
manifold `(M, g)` whose metric-space structure is the Riemannian distance of
`g` (the standing hypothesis `g.IsRiemannianDist`; without it the statements
below are false — metric completeness of an unrelated distance carries no
information about `g`), the following are equivalent:

a) `exp_p` is defined on all of `T_pM` (for one, equivalently every, `p`);
b) closed bounded subsets of `M` are compact (`ProperSpace M`);
c) `M` is complete as a metric space (`CompleteSpace M`);
d) `M` is geodesically complete (`IsGeodesicallyComplete g`);
e) `M` admits a divergent exhaustion by compacts
   (`PetersenLib.properSpace_iff_exists_compact_exhaustion`);

and any of these implies

f) every `q ∈ M` is joined to `p` by a minimizing geodesic
   (`exists_minimizing_geodesic`).

Geodesic completeness is stated **intrinsically**: for every initial datum
`(p, v)` there is a curve `γ : ℝ → M` through it satisfying the geodesic
equation `HasGeodesicEquationAt g γ t` (read in the chart at the moving foot
`γ t`) at *every* time. The chart-anchored maximal-interval framework
(`maximalGeodesicInterval`, anchored at the chart of the initial point) is
deliberately *not* used here: its witnesses solve the junk-extended equation
of a single chart, so `maximalGeodesicInterval g p v = Set.univ` fails for,
e.g., the round circle, and is *not* geodesic completeness (see
`MaximalInterval.lean`, whose docstring records that gluing integral curves
across chart changes is deferred).

Status of the circle:
* b) ⟺ e) is `PetersenLib.properSpace_iff_exists_compact_exhaustion` (proved);
* b) ⟹ c) is mathlib's `ProperSpace → CompleteSpace` instance
  (`complete_of_proper`);
* c) ⟹ d) is `isGeodesicallyComplete_of_complete` — geodesics have constant
  speed, hence are locally Lipschitz, so a maximal geodesic on a bounded
  interval is Cauchy at the endpoint, and the uniform local flow
  (`exists_uniform_geodesic_flow`) extends it past the limit. The full
  argument — Cauchy step, Gram-bounded velocity, homogeneity rescaling into
  the flow ball, intrinsic uniqueness and gluing across chart changes — is
  `exists_global_geodesic` (`Completeness.lean`);
* d) ⟹ a) is trivial; a)/d) ⟹ f) ⟹ b) ⟹ c) is the geodesic-sphere +
  connectedness argument of do Carmo: the growth induction along a fixed
  geodesic (`Exponential/GrowthInduction.lean`, fed by the metric engine of
  `Exponential/NormalBallEDist.lean` and `Exponential/MinimizingStep.lean`)
  joins every point to `p` by a minimizing geodesic; Bolzano–Weierstrass on
  the initial data of these geodesics plus endpoint continuity of geodesics
  in their initial data (the flow-box chaining of
  `Geodesic/EndpointContinuity.lean`, globalized along the connected line in
  `Geodesic/EndpointContinuityGlobal.lean`) makes closed balls compact, so
  `M` is proper, hence complete
  (`Exponential/ProperAssembly.lean`, `completeSpace_of_forall_geodesic`).

/-- **Math.** `(M, g)` is **geodesically complete**: for every `p ∈ M` and
every `v ∈ T_pM` there is a *continuous* curve `γ : ℝ → M`, defined for *all*
values of the parameter, which starts at `p` with velocity `v` (chart reading
at `p`) and satisfies the geodesic equation at every time (do Carmo Ch. 7,
Definition 2.2: "`exp_p` is defined on all of `T_pM` for every `p`"). By
uniqueness of geodesics this is equivalent to every geodesic extending to all
of `ℝ`. The geodesic equation is the intrinsic, moving-chart predicate
`HasGeodesicEquationAt` (do Carmo Ch. 3, Definition 2.1), not the
chart-of-`p`-anchored witness notion. Continuity of `γ` is demanded
explicitly: `HasGeodesicEquationAt` reads `γ` through the junk-extended
charts, so it does not by itself rule out pathological discontinuous
witnesses, while every honestly constructed geodesic (in particular the
witness produced by `exists_global_geodesic` in the c ⟹ d direction) is
continuous. -/

metric space (for the Riemannian distance of `g`), then `(M, g)` is
geodesically complete. A geodesic has constant speed, hence is Lipschitz; if
its maximal interval had a finite endpoint `b`, the curve would be Cauchy at
`b` and converge to some `p₀`; the uniform-time local geodesic flow around
`p₀` then extends the geodesic past `b`, contradicting maximality. The full
argument — Cauchy step, Gram-bounded velocity, homogeneity rescaling into
the flow ball, intrinsic uniqueness and gluing — is `exists_global_geodesic`
(`Completeness.lean`). -/

all of `T_pM` at a single point `p` (every `v ∈ T_pM` generates a continuous
global geodesic), then the **closed and bounded subsets of `M` are compact**,
i.e. `M` is a proper metric space. This is the clean single-point form of the
`a) ⟹ b)` branch of Hopf–Rinow: closed balls around `p` are compact because
they are covered by the continuous image `exp_p(\overline{B_r(0)})` of a
Euclidean ball (do Carmo's argument, via growth induction and Bolzano–Weierstrass
on the initial data). It is the `properSpace_of_forall_geodesic` assembly with
the endpoint-continuity hypothesis discharged by
`tendsto_geodesic_eval_of_tendsto_initialData`; the metric-completeness form is
`complete_of_geodesicallyComplete_at`. This is exactly the properness invoked in
the proof of the Hadamard theorem (`thm:dc-ch7-3-1`) for `T_pM` with the pulled
back metric: "the geodesics of `T_pM` through the origin are straight lines, so
the metric is complete". -/

/-- **Math.** do Carmo Ch. 7, Theorem 2.8, f): in a complete connected
Riemannian manifold any two points `x, y` are joined by a **minimizing
geodesic segment**: a geodesic `γ : [0, 1] → M` from `x` to `y`, parametrized
proportionally to arc length, with `dist (γ s) (γ t) = |s - t| * dist x y`
(so `ℓ(γ) = d(x, y)` and every subsegment is minimizing). This is the
geodesic-sphere growth induction
(`Exponential/GrowthInduction.lean`), fed by the global geodesics of
`exists_global_geodesic`; the witness is in fact a global geodesic
(`IsGeodesic`), restricted here to `[0, 1]`. -/
