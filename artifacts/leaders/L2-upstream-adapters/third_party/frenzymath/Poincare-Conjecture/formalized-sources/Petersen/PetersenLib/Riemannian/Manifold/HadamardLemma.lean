# Hadamard's lemma (do Carmo Ch.0, Lem. 5.5)

A differentiable function vanishing at the origin of its first variable factors,
smoothly in the remaining variables, as that variable times a differentiable
remainder: if `h : ℝ × U → F` is differentiable with `h 0 q = 0`, then
`h t q = t • g t q` for a differentiable `g` with `g 0 q = ∂ₜ h 0 q`.

Mathlib has no packaged Hadamard lemma; this file supplies it as reusable
project-local infrastructure.  The factoring identity is the fundamental theorem
of calculus after the substitution `u = s t`; the explicit remainder is
`g t q = ∫₀¹ (∂ₜ h)(s t) q ds`.

This is the analytic content behind `prop:dc-ch0-5-4` (bracket as Lie derivative
along the flow).

`h t q = t • g t q`, `g 0 q = pd 0 q`, and (when `pd` is jointly continuous) `g`
is jointly continuous. -/

/-! ### Joint differentiability of the Hadamard remainder

The factoring and continuity above hold with no regularity beyond a continuous
first-variable partial.  For joint *differentiability* of the remainder we use
differentiation under the integral sign, which asks for a `C¹` integrand.  There
is no packaged "`C¹`-under-the-integral" lemma in Mathlib, but the pointwise
Fréchet-derivative version `hasFDerivAt_integral_of_dominated_of_fderiv_le''` is
available, and the domination bound follows from continuity of `fderiv` on the
compact set swept by `s ∈ [0,1]` and the parameter `x` in a closed ball — hence
the finite-dimensionality hypothesis on the parameter space `E`, matching do
Carmo's `U ⊆ ℝⁿ`. -/
