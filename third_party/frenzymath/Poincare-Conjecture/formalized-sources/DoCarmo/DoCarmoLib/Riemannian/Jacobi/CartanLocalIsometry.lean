# do Carmo Ch. 8, §2 — the two assembly atoms for E. Cartan's theorem (GAP D)

This file supplies the two ingredients that stand between the already-landed analytic core of
E. Cartan's theorem in constant curvature and the statement `cor:dc-ch8-2-2` actually wants,
`DCIsLocalIsometryAt` for `f = exp_{p̃} ∘ i ∘ exp_p⁻¹`:

* **the local-diffeomorphism bridge** — `exp_p` is a `C^∞` local diffeomorphism at any `v`
  that is not a conjugate parameter. This is what turns the chart-level derivative
  isomorphism (`expDifferential_isEquiv_jacobi_of_not_conjugate`) into an honest local
  inverse `exp_p⁻¹`: with `IsLocalDiffeomorphAt` in hand, mathlib's
  `IsLocalDiffeomorphAt.localInverse` produces `exp_p⁻¹` and its smoothness, so none of that
  has to be built by hand.
* **the polarization step** — a *linear* map that preserves the **quadratic form** `⟨·,·⟩`
  preserves the **bilinear form** too. The norm transfer already landed
  (`chartMetricInner_expDifferential_transfer_of_constantCurvature_of_speedSq`) delivers only
  `|df_q(u)| = |u|`, whereas `DCIsLocalIsometryAt` is stated with the full inner product
  `⟨u,v⟩_q = ⟨df_q u, df_q v⟩`. Polarization closes exactly that gap.

## Mathematics

**Local diffeomorphism.** The proof is the curvature-free half of
`isLocalDiffeomorphAt_expMapGlobal_of_nonpos` (`HadamardNonpos.lean`): that theorem uses its
nonpositive-curvature hypothesis `hK` in exactly one place — to obtain the differential
isomorphism from `expDifferential_isEquiv_of_nonpos`. Everything after that (the target-chart
reading is `C^∞`, the normed-space inverse function theorem, composing with the chart inverse)
is curvature-free. Swapping that single input for
`expDifferential_isEquiv_of_not_conjugate` gives the same conclusion under the weaker and
sign-free hypothesis `¬ IsConjugatePointAt`, which is the form `cor:dc-ch8-2-2` needs — it must
work in **positive** curvature too, where `hK` is unavailable. The global smoothness of `exp_p`
(`contMDiff_expMapGlobal`, unconditional since the Ch. 7 work) discharges the `hsmooth`
hypothesis that `HadamardNonpos.lean` still carries, so this version is unconditional.

**Polarization.** Over `ℝ`, a symmetric bilinear form is recovered from its diagonal:

  `⟨u,v⟩ = (⟨u+v,u+v⟩ − ⟨u,u⟩ − ⟨v,v⟩)/2`.

So if `L` is additive and `⟨L w, L w⟩' = ⟨w,w⟩` for every `w`, then applying the identity on
both sides and using additivity at `w = u+v` gives `⟨L u, L v⟩' = ⟨u,v⟩`. Note this needs `L`
**additive** — a norm-preserving *nonlinear* map need not preserve inner products; in the
application `L = df_q` is linear, so the hypothesis is free.

## Contents

* `metricInner_polarization` — `⟨u,v⟩ = (⟨u+v,u+v⟩ − ⟨u,u⟩ − ⟨v,v⟩)/2`.
* `metricInner_transfer_of_norm_transfer` — an additive quadratic-form-preserving map
  preserves the bilinear form (the polarization step of `DCIsLocalIsometryAt`).
* `isLocalDiffeomorphAt_expMapGlobal_of_not_conjugate` — `exp_p` is a `C^∞` local
  diffeomorphism at a non-conjugate `v`, unconditionally.

/-! ### Polarization: the diagonal determines a symmetric bilinear form -/

/-- **Math.** **The polarization identity for a Riemannian metric.** Over `ℝ` the symmetric
bilinear form `g` is recovered from its diagonal (the squared norm):

  `⟨u,v⟩ = (⟨u+v,u+v⟩ − ⟨u,u⟩ − ⟨v,v⟩)/2`.

Immediate from bilinearity and symmetry. Stated over `TangentSpace I x` so that the
`metricInner_add_left/right` lemmas apply directly — they do **not** fire on `E`-typed sums,
since `TangentSpace I x` is a semireducible def of `E`. -/

/-- **Math.** **An additive map preserving squared norms preserves the inner product.**
If `L : T_qM → T_{q'}M'` is **additive** and `|L w|²_{q'} = |w|²_q` for every `w`, then
`⟨L u, L v⟩_{q'} = ⟨u,v⟩_q` for all `u, v`.

This is the step from the norm transfer
(`chartMetricInner_expDifferential_transfer_of_constantCurvature_of_speedSq`, which gives only
the diagonal `|df_q u| = |u|`) to `DCIsLocalIsometryAt`, which is stated with the full inner
product. Both sides are expanded with `metricInner_polarization` and matched using additivity
at `u + v`.

Additivity is essential: a norm-preserving *nonlinear* map need not preserve inner products.
In the application `L = df_q` is a continuous linear map, so `hadd` is free. -/

/-! ### `exp_p` is a `C^∞` local diffeomorphism away from conjugate points -/

/-- **Math.** **`exp_p` is a `C^∞` local diffeomorphism at a non-conjugate `v`.** If the
parameter `1` is not conjugate along `γ_v` — equivalently, no nontrivial Jacobi field along
`γ_v` vanishes at both ends — then `exp_p` is a `C^∞` local diffeomorphism at `v`.

This is the sign-free strengthening of `isLocalDiffeomorphAt_expMapGlobal_of_nonpos`
(`HadamardNonpos.lean`), which reaches the same conclusion only under `K ≤ 0`. That hypothesis
enters its proof at exactly one point — obtaining the differential isomorphism from
`expDifferential_isEquiv_of_nonpos` — so replacing that single input with
`expDifferential_isEquiv_of_not_conjugate` yields this version verbatim. The distinction
matters for do Carmo Ch. 8: `cor:dc-ch8-2-2` must handle spaces of **positive** constant
curvature, where `K ≤ 0` is unavailable but non-conjugacy still holds on a small enough ball.

Unlike the `HadamardNonpos.lean` original this carries **no** `hsmooth` hypothesis: the global
`C^∞` smoothness of `exp_p` is now unconditional (`contMDiff_expMapGlobal`).

With `IsLocalDiffeomorphAt` established, mathlib's `IsLocalDiffeomorphAt.localInverse` supplies
`exp_p⁻¹` together with its smoothness — so the `f = exp_{p̃} ∘ i ∘ exp_p⁻¹` of Cartan's theorem
can be assembled without hand-building the inverse.
