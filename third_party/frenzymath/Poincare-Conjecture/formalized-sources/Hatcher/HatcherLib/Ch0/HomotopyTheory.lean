# Chapter 0 — Homotopy and homotopy type

This file records the correspondence between the geometric notions of Hatcher's
Chapter 0, *Some Underlying Geometric Notions* (§ "Homotopy and Homotopy Type"),
and mathlib's `ContinuousMap` homotopy library. Most of Hatcher's definitions are
already present in mathlib, so we expose them as thin aliases (pure reuse — no
re-formalization) so that the blueprint's `\lean{…}` markers resolve to
Hatcher-namespaced names.

Two notions that Hatcher constructs by hand and mathlib does not package are
added here directly:

* `HatcherLib.IsRetraction` — a retraction `r`, characterised by `r ∘ r = r`;
* `HatcherLib.DeformationRetract` — a deformation retraction of `X` onto a
  subspace `A`,

together with the basic fact `DeformationRetract.homotopyEquiv`: a deformation
retraction of `X` onto `A` exhibits `A` and `X` as homotopy equivalent (Hatcher's
`r i = 𝟙`, `i r ≃ 𝟙`).
