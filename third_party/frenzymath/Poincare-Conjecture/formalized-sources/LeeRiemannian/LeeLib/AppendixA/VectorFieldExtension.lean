Appendix A, "Review of Smooth Manifolds": the **extension lemma for vector
fields**, in the pointwise form used by Chapter 2.

Lee states the general extension lemma (his Lemma A.23) for a smooth vector field
defined on a closed subset.  What Chapter 2 actually consumes is the special case
of a *single point*:

> every tangent vector `v ∈ T_p M` is the value at `p` of some global smooth
> vector field `Z ∈ 𝔛(M)`.

## Why this is not immediate

`TangentSpace I p` is a fibre of a bundle, and a vector in it carries no
information about neighbouring fibres, so producing a *global* field requires
gluing.  The two ingredients are:

* **locally**, a vector extends: near `p` the constant section of a local
  trivialization `e` — `x ↦ e.symm x c`, where `c` is the fibre coordinate of `v`
  — is smooth and takes the value `v` at `p`.  Away from `p`, the zero section
  works.
* **globally**, these are glued by mathlib's
  `exists_contMDiffSection_forall_mem_convex_of_local`, whose hypothesis is a
  *convex* fibrewise constraint set.  Taking `t p = {v}` and `t x = univ` for
  `x ≠ p` makes the constraint convex (a singleton and the whole fibre both are),
  and the glued section then satisfies `s p ∈ {v}`, i.e. `s p = v`.

The convexity is what makes a partition of unity legitimate here: a convex
combination of local sections each lying in `t x` still lies in `t x`.  This is
the same mechanism by which a Riemannian metric is built in
`LeeLib.Ch02.exists_riemannianMetric` (there `t x` is the set of positive
definite forms, convex for the same reason).

## Provenance

The construction is the one vendored throughout this workspace (`DoCarmoLib`,
`PetersenLib.Vendored.OpenGA.Manifold.DoCarmoCh2.exists_smoothVectorField_eq`).
Cross-project `lake` dependencies are banned in this workspace, so each project
vendors its own copy; this is Lee's.

/-- **The extension lemma for vector fields, at a point** (Lee, the case of
Lemma A.23 used in Chapter 2): *every tangent vector is the value of a global
smooth vector field.*

Given `p : M` and `v : T_p M`, there is a smooth vector field `Z` on `M` with
`Z p = v`.

The σ-compactness and Hausdorff hypotheses are Lee's standing assumptions on
manifolds; they are what make smooth partitions of unity available, and the
statement is false without some such assumption. -/
