Chapter 2, "Riemannian Metrics", Problem 2-16: the fibre metric on `Λ^k T^*M`.

Lee asks for the unique fibre metric `⟨·,·⟩_g` on `Λ^k T^*M` satisfying

  `⟨ω^1 ∧ ⋯ ∧ ω^k, η^1 ∧ ⋯ ∧ η^k⟩_g = det (⟨ω^i, η^j⟩_g)`                              (2.26)

for covectors `ω^i, η^j` at a point.  This file builds the fibrewise algebra: the inner product on
`V [⋀^ι]→L[ℝ] ℝ` for an inner product space `V`, its characterization (2.26), positive
definiteness, uniqueness, and independence of the orthonormal basis used to define it.  The
remaining step -- assembling the pointwise family into a smooth fibre metric on the bundle
`LeeLib.AppendixA.AlternatingBundle` builds over `M` -- is not done here.

Nothing upstream helps.  Mathlib has no inner product on `exteriorPower`, `AlternatingMap`,
`ContinuousAlternatingMap`, `MultilinearMap` or `PiTensorProduct` (only on the *binary*
`TensorProduct`, in `Analysis/InnerProductSpace/TensorProduct.lean`), and no Hodge star; nor does
any sibling project in this workspace.  `exteriorPower.pairingDual` is a duality pairing between
`⋀^k (V^*)` and `(⋀^k V)^*`, needs no metric, and is not a self-pairing.

## The route

Lee's hint is to *declare* `{e^{i_1} ∧ ⋯ ∧ e^{i_k} : i_1 < ⋯ < i_k}` orthonormal for an
orthonormal coframe `(e^i)`, then check (2.26) and independence of the frame.  Formalizing that
literally means carrying strictly-increasing multi-indices through every computation.  This file
avoids them entirely by summing over **all** maps `s : ι → ι'` instead, with a `1/k!` correction:

  `innerForms e w θ = (∑_{s : ι → ι'} w (e ∘ s) · θ (e ∘ s)) / k!`.

The terms where `s` is not injective are not discarded by hand -- they simply do not contribute,
because `w` is alternating -- and each increasing multi-index is counted `k!` times with the two
sign changes cancelling.  Bilinearity, symmetry and positive definiteness are then immediate from
the shape of the definition (`innerForms e w w` is a sum of squares), which is the main reason to
prefer it: in the increasing-multi-index formulation none of these is immediate.

Everything else follows from one identity, `AlternatingMap.sum_det_submatrix_smul_apply` in
`LeeLib.AppendixB.CauchyBinet` (Cauchy-Binet with one determinant replaced by an arbitrary
alternating map), applied twice with different matrices:

* with `A_{i m} = ω^i (e_m)` it gives **(2.26)** (`innerForms_wedgeCovectors`);
* with `A_{i m} = ⟪e_{v(i)}, e_m⟫` it gives the **expansion of an arbitrary `k`-covector** in
  wedges of the dual coframe (`factorial_smul_eq_sum_wedgeCovectors`), hence that the wedges span
  (`span_range_wedgeCovectors`), hence **uniqueness** (`eq_innerForms_of_wedgeCovectors`).

Frame independence (`innerForms_eq_innerForms`) is then a *corollary of uniqueness* rather than a
separate change-of-basis computation: `innerForms e` and `innerForms f` both satisfy (2.26), which
determines a bilinear form on a spanning set.  This is why (2.26) is proved for an arbitrary
orthonormal basis rather than a fixed one.

is `∑_s (ω^1 ∧ ⋯ ∧ ω^k)(e ∘ s) · (η^1 ∧ ⋯ ∧ η^k)(e ∘ s)`, because `det (A[·, s])` is by definition
the wedge evaluated on `e ∘ s`; and its right-hand side is `k! · (η^1 ∧ ⋯ ∧ η^k)((ω^i)^♯)`,
because `∑_m ω^i(e_m) e_m` is the Riesz representative `(ω^i)^♯`.  The determinant that comes out
