Chapter 2, "Riemannian Metrics", §"Isometries": **local isometries**, and Lee's
Exercise 2.7 identifying them, between manifolds of equal dimension, with the
smooth maps satisfying `φ^* g̃ = g`.

Lee defines a *local isometry* `φ : M → M̃` as a map each of whose points has a
neighbourhood on which `φ` restricts to an isometry onto an open subset of `M̃`,
and Exercise 2.7 asks:

> if `(M,g)` and `(M̃,g̃)` are Riemannian manifolds of the same dimension, a
> smooth map `φ : M → M̃` is a local isometry if and only if `φ^* g̃ = g`.

The easy direction needs no hypothesis on dimensions and was already available
(`IsMetricPreserving` is a pointwise condition, so it is inherited by any
restriction).  The substance is the converse: `φ^* g̃ = g` forces each `dφ_p` to be
injective — it is a linear isometry onto its image — and equal dimensions promote
that to invertible, at which point the **inverse function theorem for manifolds**
makes `φ` a local diffeomorphism.  That theorem is neither in mathlib (it is the
`## TODO` of `Mathlib/Geometry/Manifold/LocalDiffeomorph.lean`) nor in Lee's
Appendix A other than as a citation of the *Smooth Manifolds* volume; it is proved
in `LeeLib.AppendixA.InverseFunctionTheorem`, and this file is its first consumer.

## Why `IsLocalDiffeomorph ∧ IsMetricPreserving` is Lee's definition

`IsLocalIsometry` is spelled below as `IsLocalDiffeomorph I I' ∞ φ ∧ IsMetricPreserving g g' φ`
rather than as an explicit "`∀ p`, there are `U ∋ p` and open `V` with `φ|_U : U → V`
an isometry".  These agree, and the reason is that metric preservation is a
*pointwise* condition on `dφ_p`:

* Lee's version gives, at each `p`, a neighbourhood `U` on which `φ` restricts to a
  diffeomorphism onto an open set — that is exactly mathlib's `IsLocalDiffeomorph`,
  which unfolds to a `PartialDiffeomorph` through each point — and on which `dφ_q`
  carries `g_q` to `g̃_{φ(q)}`; since every `p` lies in its own `U`, that holds at
  every point of `M`, which is `IsMetricPreserving`.
* Conversely, given both conditions, the `U` supplied by `IsLocalDiffeomorph` at `p`
  restricts `φ` to a diffeomorphism onto an open `V`, and it preserves the metric
  because `dφ` does so at every point.

Taking the conjunction as the definition avoids having to restrict `g` and `g̃` to
open submanifolds merely in order to *state* the definition, and it keeps Exercise
2.7 honest: the content of the exercise is entirely the implication
`IsMetricPreserving → IsLocalDiffeomorph`, and that is where the inverse function
theorem is used.

/-- An injective continuous linear map between finite-dimensional spaces of equal dimension is
invertible.

Stated over bare normed spaces rather than over `TangentSpace`s: instances on `TangentSpace I x`
are a defeq copy of those on the model `E`, but they are not *syntactically* the model's, so
`FiniteDimensional` will not synthesize for them even though `exact` accepts the result. -/

/-! ### Local isometries -/

/-- **Local isometry** (Lee, §"Isometries"): a map that restricts, near every point, to an isometry
onto an open subset.

See the module docstring for why this conjunction is Lee's definition: `IsLocalDiffeomorph` *is*
"restricts near every point to a diffeomorphism onto an open set", and metric preservation is a
pointwise condition, so localizing it changes nothing. -/

If `φ : (M,g) → (M̃,g̃)` is a local isometry then `d_{g̃}(φ x, φ y) ≤ d_g(x, y)` for
all `x, y`.

This is `IsMetricPreserving.riemannianEDist_le` fed the underlying metric-preserving
map: a local isometry is in particular a local diffeomorphism, hence smooth
(`IsLocalDiffeomorph.contMDiff`), so every admissible curve from `x` to `y` maps to a
curve of equal length from `φ x` to `φ y`.  Equality can fail — `M̃` may contain
shorter curves outside the image of `φ`, as for the length-decreasing wraps of the
Riemannian covering `ℝ → S¹`. -/

/-- **A metric-preserving smooth map between manifolds of equal dimension is a local
diffeomorphism** — the substance of Lee's Exercise 2.7.

`φ^* g̃ = g` makes each `dφ_p` a linear isometry onto its image, hence injective; equal dimensions
promote injective to invertible; and the inverse function theorem for manifolds
(`LeeLib.AppendixA.isLocalDiffeomorphAt_of_contMDiff_mfderiv_isInvertible`, which is mathlib's own
`LocalDiffeomorph` TODO) turns that into a local diffeomorphism at each point. -/

The forward implication is immediate from the definition.  The converse is the inverse function
