# Morgan–Tian Ch. 1, §1.4 — `exp_p` is differentiable read in *any* chart

`Ch01/ExpDifferential.lean` produces, for each `v ∈ T_pM`, *some* chart `ζ` around `exp_p(v)` in
which `exp_p` has a derivative at `v` (the chart is whichever one the Jacobi-transport chain hands
back). That is enough to talk about `d(exp_p)_v` up to conjugation, but it is *not* enough for the
measure theory: to prove that `exp_p` carries null sets to null sets we must read `exp_p` in a
*prescribed* chart — the one covering the piece of `M` we are integrating over — and know it is
differentiable there.

This file removes the chart from the statement:

  `differentiableAt_extChartAt_expMapGlobal` :
    for every `α : M` with `exp_p(v) ∈ (extChartAt I α).source`,
    `w ↦ extChartAt I α (exp_p w)` is differentiable at `v`.

The proof is the only thing it can be: transition maps are smooth. Writing `ζ` for the chart
supplied by `ExpDifferential`, near `v` we have

  `extChartAt α ∘ exp_p = (extChartAt α ∘ (extChartAt ζ).symm) ∘ (extChartAt ζ ∘ exp_p)`,

the outer factor being differentiable by `hasFDerivWithinAt_tangentCoordChange` (with
`range I = univ`, as `I` is boundaryless) and the inner one by `ExpDifferential`. The identity holds
only *near* `v` — one needs `exp_p w` to stay in the source of `ζ`, which continuity of `exp_p`
supplies — so the conclusion is transported along an `EventuallyEq`.

/-- **Math.** **`exp_p` is differentiable at every `v`, read in every chart around `exp_p(v)`.**

No hypothesis beyond completeness: the exponential map of a complete Riemannian manifold is
differentiable everywhere on `T_pM` (indeed smooth, but differentiability is all the change of
variables needs), and the chart in which one reads it is immaterial. -/
