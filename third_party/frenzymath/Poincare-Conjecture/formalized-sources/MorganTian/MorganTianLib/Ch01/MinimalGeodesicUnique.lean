# Poincaré Ch. 1 — the minimal restriction of a minimal geodesic is *unique*

This file closes **Part 1** of Morgan–Tian's `prop:minimal-geodesic-no-conjugate`:

> if `γ : [0,1] → M` is a minimal geodesic and `0 < t₀ < 1`, then `γ|[0,t₀]` is the **unique**
> minimal geodesic between its endpoints.

Together with Part 2 (`not_isConjugatePointAt_of_minimizing`,
`Ch01/MinimalGeodesicNoConjugate.lean`, landed in run 0118) this completes the proposition.

## Deviation from Morgan–Tian: no first variation with a corner

Morgan–Tian argue by the **first variation of energy at a corner**: if a second minimal geodesic
`μ` existed, the concatenation `c = μ ⋆ γ|[t₀,1]` would have a corner `Δ = γ′(t₀) − μ′(t₀) ≠ 0`,
and a variation with `Y(t₀) = Δ` would give `E′(0) = −|Δ|² < 0`, contradicting that `c` minimizes
energy.

We take a **shorter and strictly stronger route**, which reuses machinery already in DoCarmoLib and
needs no variation at all:

* `c` is piecewise `C¹`, parameterized proportionally to arclength, and realizes the distance
  between its endpoints (its length is `ℓ = ℓ(μ) + ℓ(γ|[t₀,1]) = d(γ 0, γ 1)`);
* therefore **`c` has no corner**: do Carmo's Cor. 3.9, formalized as
  `Riemannian.Exponential.isGeodesicOn_piecewise_of_arclength_edist`, says a minimizing
  piecewise-`C¹` arclength curve satisfies the geodesic equation at *every interior time* —
  **including the partition vertex `t₀`**.  (Under the hood this is exactly the corner-rigidity
  argument `eq_neg_of_forall_edist_expMap_eq`: two unit legs leaving `x` whose concatenation
  realizes `d = 2η` must leave in opposite directions.)
* so `c` is a genuine geodesic on `(0,1)`; it agrees with `γ` on `(t₀, 1)`, hence in position *and*
  chart velocity at any interior time there, so **ODE uniqueness**
  (`IsGeodesicOn.eqOn_of_deriv_chartReading_eq`) forces `c = γ` on all of `(0,1)`.  On `(0, t₀)`
  that reads `μ = γ`, and continuity closes the endpoints.

The first-variation route would have required generalising `exists_brokenVariationData` from a
*single geodesic* base curve to a *piecewise geodesic* one — a substantial refactor of the
broken-chart-variation machinery.  The corner-rigidity route sidesteps it entirely.  The
mathematical content is the same theorem of do Carmo that Morgan–Tian's first-variation argument
is a proof of; see the blueprint remark `rem:part1-corner-rigidity-route`.

## Hypothesis shape — and the one reduction that is *not* formalized here

Both geodesics are asked for on an **open time window with room at the ends** (`Ioo a b ⊇ [0,1]`
for `γ`, `Ioo a' b' ⊇ [0,t₀]` for `μ`); this is the same shape as
`not_isConjugatePointAt_of_minimizing`.  Morgan–Tian instead hand you a competitor
`μ : [0,t₀] → M` on the *closed* interval.  Bridging the two is a **routine but genuinely
unformalized** reduction, and it is stated here rather than buried:

* **Extension.**  A geodesic on `[0,t₀]` extends to `(-ε, t₀+ε)` by *local* ODE existence at the
  two endpoints — solve the geodesic equation from `(μ 0, μ′ 0)` backwards and from
  `(μ t₀, μ′ t₀)` forwards.  This needs **no completeness of `M`** (and note this file assumes
  only `[CompleteSpace E]`, completeness of the *model space*, which is not geodesic completeness
  of `M`; `globalGeodesic` is therefore *not* the discharge here).
* **Reparameterization.**  A competitor presented on `[0,1]` must be affinely rescaled to
  `[0,t₀]`; `globalGeodesic_smul` is the workspace's tool for that.

Neither bridge is proved in this file, so a caller supplying an arbitrary closed-interval `μ` must
do the reduction itself.

**But the caller that matters does not have to.**  The consumer of Part 1 is the injectivity clause
of `prop:exponential-diffeomorphism-cut-locus`, whose competitors are *radial* geodesics
`γ_v = globalGeodesic p v` — already defined on all of `ℝ`.  For those the extension hypothesis is
free, and `globalGeodesic_eqOn_of_minimizing` (bottom of this file) is stated with **no time-window
hypotheses at all**.  That is the form to reach for.

Blueprint: `prop:minimal-geodesic-no-conjugate` (Part 1).

/-! ### Clause 1 of Part 1: every restriction of a minimal geodesic is itself minimal -/

/-- **Math.** **`γ|[0,t]` is minimal, for every `t ∈ [0,1]`** — the *first* assertion of Part 1 of
`prop:minimal-geodesic-no-conjugate` ("the restriction of `γ` to `[0,t]` is **the unique minimal
geodesic** between its endpoints": this lemma is the *minimal*, `minimalGeodesic_restrict_unique`
the *unique*).

If `γ` is a geodesic on an open window `(a,b) ⊇ [0,1]` which is minimizing on `[0,1]` — its speed
`ℓ = √⟨γ′,γ′⟩`, which for a unit-time geodesic *is* its length, is at most `d(γ 0, γ 1)` — then for
every `t ∈ [0,1]`

`d(γ 0, γ t) = ℓ · t`,

i.e. the length `ℓ · t` of `γ|[0,t]` equals the distance between its endpoints.

*Proof.*  Morgan–Tian cut the competitor argument short with the triangle inequality, and so do we.
Minimality gives `d(γ 0, γ 1) = ℓ` (`dist_eq_sqrt_speedSq_of_minimizing`).  A geodesic is Lipschitz
with constant its speed (`IsGeodesicOn.dist_le`), and its speed is constant
(`IsGeodesicOn.speedSq_eq`), so `d(γ 0, γ t) ≤ ℓ t` and `d(γ t, γ 1) ≤ ℓ (1 - t)`.  Then

`ℓ = d(γ 0, γ 1) ≤ d(γ 0, γ t) + d(γ t, γ 1) ≤ d(γ 0, γ t) + ℓ (1 - t)`,

so `d(γ 0, γ t) ≥ ℓ t`, and the two bounds meet. ∎  (No competitor curve `σ` is ever produced: the
triangle inequality *is* the "shortcut then continue" argument, since `d` is already an infimum over
all curves.)

/-! ### Clause 2 of Part 1: that minimal restriction is the *only* one

**A note on the `ENorm (TangentSpace I x)` instance — read this before touching `pathELength`.**
`Manifold.pathELength` measures with an `ENorm` on the tangent spaces, and *which* `ENorm` is not
automatic.  The norm induced by the Riemannian metric reaches `TangentSpace I x` through mathlib's
`RiemannianBundle → NormedAddCommGroup (E b)` instance, which is **`scoped` to the `Bundle`
namespace** (`Mathlib/Topology/VectorBundle/Riemannian.lean`, priority 80).  Every DoCarmoLib file
that states a `pathELength` lemma has `open Bundle` in force, so that is the instance baked into
their statements.  A file *without* `open scoped Bundle` synthesizes the **model-space** norm
instead — a genuinely different, **non-defeq** instance (a `show` between the two fails).  A
`letI : Bundle.RiemannianBundle …` does *not* repair this: it supplies the bundle, but the
`NormedAddCommGroup` step off it is still the scoped instance.

Symptom: `rw [Manifold.pathELength_congr …]` reports "did not find an occurrence of the pattern
`Manifold.pathELength I c 0 t`" in a goal that displays as exactly that.  Cure: `open scoped Bundle`
(done at the top of this file).  This is the sharp form of the warning `Ch01/BrokenEnergy.lean`
records as "stating them by hand picks a different route to the tangent `ENorm`". -/

/-- **Math.** **Part 1 of `prop:minimal-geodesic-no-conjugate`: the minimal restriction of a
minimal geodesic is unique.**

Let `γ` be a geodesic on an open window `(a, b) ⊇ [0, 1]` whose restriction to `[0, 1]` is
**minimizing** — in the workspace's normalisation (`Ch01/GeodesicSpeed.lean`), its speed, which for
a unit-time geodesic *is* its length, is at most `d(γ 0, γ 1)`.  Fix `0 < t₀ < 1` and let `μ` be
*any* geodesic on an open window `(a', b') ⊇ [0, t₀]` with the same endpoints as `γ|[0,t₀]` and
which is minimizing on `[0, t₀]` (its length `√⟨μ′,μ′⟩ · t₀` is at most `d(μ 0, μ t₀)`).  Then

`μ = γ` on `[0, t₀]`.

*Proof.*  Write `ℓ = √⟨γ′,γ′⟩`.  Minimality of `γ` gives `d(γ 0, γ 1) = ℓ`
(`dist_eq_sqrt_speedSq_of_minimizing`), and the triangle inequality against the Lipschitz bound
`IsGeodesicOn.dist_le` upgrades this to sub-arc minimality, `d(γ 0, γ t₀) = ℓ · t₀`.  The same
Lipschitz bound and the minimality of `μ` then pin `μ`'s speed: `√⟨μ′,μ′⟩ = ℓ`.

Let `c = concatAt t₀ μ γ`.  It is piecewise `C¹` for the partition `0 < t₀ < 1`, its
`Manifold.pathELength` from `0` to `t` is `ℓ · t` throughout `[0, 1]` (each leg is a geodesic of
speed `ℓ`; `IsGeodesicOn.pathELength_eq` and `pathELength_add`), and it realizes the distance
between its endpoints (`edist (c 0) (c 1) = ofReal ℓ`).  So `c` is a minimizing, arclength
piecewise-`C¹` curve, and **do Carmo's Cor. 3.9** — `isGeodesicOn_piecewise_of_arclength_edist` —
says it satisfies the geodesic equation on the *open* interval `(0, 1)`, **including at the
vertex `t₀`**: a minimizing broken geodesic has no corner.

Finally `c = γ` on `(t₀, 1)`, so `c` and `γ` agree in position and chart velocity at, say,
`t₁ = (t₀+1)/2`.  Both are geodesics on the open preconnected `(0, 1)`, so uniqueness of geodesics
(`IsGeodesicOn.eqOn_of_deriv_chartReading_eq`) gives `c = γ` on all of `(0, 1)`; on `(0, t₀)` that
is `μ = γ`, and the two endpoints are the matching hypotheses. ∎

/-! ### The proposition, in Morgan–Tian's phrasing -/

/-- **Math.** **`prop:minimal-geodesic-no-conjugate`, Part 1, as Morgan–Tian state it.**

If `γ` is a minimal geodesic on `[0, 1]` and `t₀ < 1`, then the restriction `γ|[0,t₀]` is *the*
minimal geodesic between its endpoints: any minimal geodesic `μ` from `γ 0` to `γ t₀`,
parameterized by `[0, t₀]`, coincides with it.

This is `eqOn_of_minimizing_geodesic_of_minimizing_geodesic` with its hypotheses named the way the
text does.  The minimality of `μ` is written as `ℓ(μ) ≤ d(μ 0, μ t₀)` with
`ℓ(μ) = √⟨μ′, μ′⟩ · t₀` the length of a constant-speed curve on `[0, t₀]` — the same normalisation
as `γ`'s (`Ch01/GeodesicSpeed.lean`). -/

/-! ### The form the cut locus consumes: two *global* geodesics from `p` -/

/-- **Math.** **Part 1 for radial geodesics: two minimal `globalGeodesic`s from `p` reaching the
same point at time `t₀ < 1` coincide up to `t₀`.**

This is the shape `prop:exponential-diffeomorphism-cut-locus` actually consumes (condition (i) of
`def:cut-locus` is exactly "`γ_w` is the *unique* minimal geodesic from `p` to `exp_p w`"), and it
carries **no extension hypothesis at all**: `globalGeodesic` is defined on all of `ℝ` and is a
geodesic there (`isGeodesic_globalGeodesic`, `continuous_globalGeodesic`), so the open time windows
of `eqOn_of_minimizing_geodesic_of_minimizing_geodesic` are free — take `(-1, 2)` and `(-1, t₀+1)`.

`γ = globalGeodesic p v` is assumed minimizing on `[0, 1]` and `μ = globalGeodesic p w` minimizing
on `[0, t₀]`; both start at `p` (`globalGeodesic_zero`), and they are assumed to meet at `t₀`.  Then
they agree on all of `[0, t₀]`.

Blueprint: `prop:minimal-geodesic-no-conjugate` (Part 1); `prop:exponential-diffeomorphism-cut-locus`
(the injectivity clause). -/
