# Morgan–Tian Ch. 2 — joint `C¹` regularity of the chart-local flow in `(x, t)`

Blueprint `prop:parallel-gradient-splitting` Step 4, analytic engine for the sharp
ℓ² product formula: the uniform-time local flow `Z` of an autonomous `C¹` field
`f : E → E` is **jointly `C¹` in the initial condition and the time** on the open
box `ball z₀ r × (0, T)`.

`FlowVariation.exists_localFlow_hasStrictFDerivAt` produced, at every base point
`x` of the flow ball separately, a strict space-derivative `D(x)` characterized by
the linearized (variational) Volterra equation along the base trajectory. The new
content here is **continuity of `x ↦ D(x)`** and its consequence, joint `C¹`:

* the space-derivative is the Neumann resolvent
  `D(x) = (1 - J∘M_{A₀(x)})⁻¹ ∘ const` — realized here by the *total* function
  `x ↦ Ring.inverse (1 - J∘M_{A₀(x)}) ∘ const`, which agrees with the unit inverse
  on the flow ball;
* the operator curve `A₀(x) = (df) ∘ σ(x)` is continuous in sup norm, by
  Heine–Cantor uniform continuity of `df` on the compact confinement ball plus
  Lipschitz dependence of the trajectory on its initial condition;
* the Volterra composite `A ↦ J∘M_A` is `T`-Lipschitz
  (`norm_intervalPrimitive_comp_postcompCurve_sub_le`), and Banach-algebra
  inversion is continuous at units (`NormedRing.inverse_continuousAt`);
* solutions of the variational equation are Lipschitz in time with constant
  `‖A₀‖ ‖D‖` (`norm_evalCLM_comp_sub_evalCLM_comp_le`), so the evaluated
  space-partial `(x, t) ↦ evalCLM t ∘ D(x)` is *jointly* continuous;
* the time-partial derivative is `f (Z x t)`, jointly continuous since the flow
  is; mathlib's `hasStrictFDerivAt_uncurry_coprod` (continuous partial
  derivatives ⟹ joint strict differentiability) then gives joint strict
  differentiability at every point of the open box, hence joint `C¹` by
  `Riemannian.FlowDependence.contDiffOn_one_of_forall_hasStrictFDerivAt`.

Main declaration:

* `exists_localFlow_hasStrictFDerivAt_uncurry` — a uniform-time local flow `Z` on
  `closedBall z₀ r` (flow ODE on `[-ε, ε]`, confinement in the prescribed open
  region `Ω`, joint continuity), a Picard time `0 < T < ε`, and a space-derivative
  field `Dx` such that on the open box `ball z₀ r ×ˢ Ioo 0 T`: each `Dx x t` is
  the space-partial derivative of `Z` at `(x, t)`, the field `↿Dx` is continuous,
  the uncurried flow `↿Z` is strictly differentiable at every point of the box
  with derivative `(Dx x t).coprod (τ ↦ τ • f (Z x t))`, and `↿Z` is `C¹` there.

Downstream (manifold level): transfer through a chart and glue by the flow group
law to make `(t, x) ↦ θ_t(x)` a `C¹` map on `ℝ × M`, the regularity needed for the
tilted-competitor-path and level-projection arguments of the sharp product metric
identity in blueprint `prop:parallel-gradient-splitting`.
