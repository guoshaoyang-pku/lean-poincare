# Morgan–Tian Ch. 2, §2.6 — Forward difference maximum property, flow case

The general form of Morgan–Tian's "forward difference maximum property"
(blueprint `prop:forward-difference-maximum`): on a space `M` carrying a time
function `tt : M → [a, b]` and a function `F : M → ℝ`, if the fibrewise
maximizer set `𝒵` is compact, every fibre `tt⁻¹(t)` attains its maximum, and
near `𝒵` there is a local flow moving at unit `tt`-speed along which `F`
differentiates to `χF ≤ ψ(tt, F)`, then the fibrewise maximum
`F_max(t) = max {F x : tt x = t}` is continuous
(`continuousOn_levelMax`), has forward difference quotient at most
`ψ(t, F_max t)` (`forwardDiffQuotientLE_levelMax`), and hence is dominated by
every solution of `G' = ψ(t, G)` with `F_max a ≤ G a`
(`levelMax_le_of_isLocalFlow`).

## Design notes

* The statement is purely topological: no manifold structure is used. The
  local flow of the vector field `χ` near the compact set `𝒵` — the content
  of the flow-box lemma, blueprint `lem:vector-field-flow-near-compact`,
  formalized in `MorganTianLib.Ch02.FlowBox` — enters as the hypothesis bundle
  `IsLocalFlow tt F χF U η Φ`, packaging exactly the conclusions of that
  lemma that the maximum principle consumes: `Φ x 0 = x`, unit `tt`-speed
  `tt (Φ x s) = tt x + s`, differentiability of `F` along flow lines with
  derivative `χF ∘ Φ x` (the blueprint's `χ(F)`), and joint continuity.
  `FlowBox.lean` discharges the bundle with the genuine flow of a smooth
  vector field (`exists_isLocalFlow_of_isCompact`) and derives the
  manifold-level maximum principle `levelMax_le_of_dir_le`, blueprint
  `prop:forward-difference-maximum`.
* Where the blueprint integrates `χ(F)` along flow lines, we use the mean
  value inequality (`Convex.norm_image_sub_le_of_norm_hasDerivWithin_le`)
  for the two-sided Lipschitz estimate of Step 1 and the mean value theorem
  (`exists_hasDerivAt_eq_slope`) for the contradiction argument of Step 2.
  Sequential compactness is replaced by the cluster-point argument of
  `forwardDiffQuotientLE_iSup`, so no metrizability of `M` is needed.

/-- **Local flow data** for the forward difference maximum principle
(Morgan–Tian §2.6). On an open set `U` and for times `|s| < η`, the map `Φ`
behaves like the local flow of a vector field `χ` satisfying `χ(tt) = 1` and
`χ(F) = χF`: it fixes points at time `0`, moves the time function `tt` at unit
speed, differentiates `F` along flow lines with derivative `χF` at the moving
point, and is jointly continuous. This is precisely the conclusion of the
flow-box lemma (blueprint `lem:vector-field-flow-near-compact`) in the form
consumed by `prop:forward-difference-maximum`. -/

continuous.** If the fibrewise maximizer set `𝒵` is compact, contained in the
domain of a local flow at unit `tt`-speed, and every fibre over `[a, b]`
attains its maximum, then `F_max` is (locally Lipschitz, hence) continuous on
`[a, b]`: flowing a maximizer at time `t₁` forward to time `t₂` bounds
`F_max t₁ - F_max t₂`, and flowing a maximizer at time `t₂` backward bounds
the other difference, both by `C |t₂ - t₁|` with `C` a bound for `χF` on the
compact flow saturation of `𝒵`. -/

bound.** At `t₀ ∈ [a, b)`, if every fibrewise maximizer at time `t₀` satisfies
`χF ≤ c`, then the fibrewise maximum has forward difference quotient at most
`c` at `t₀`. The proof is by contradiction: a right slope `≥ r > c` at
time `z → t₀⁺` forces, by flowing the maximizer at time `z` backwards and the
mean value theorem, a point `Φ y_z τ_z` with `χF ≥ r`; a cluster point of
`(y_z, τ_z)` in the compact set `𝒵 × [-η', 0]` is a fibrewise maximizer at

/-- **Forward difference maximum property** (Morgan–Tian, Proposition 2.23;
blueprint `prop:forward-difference-maximum`). Let `tt : M → [a, b]` be a time
function and `F : M → ℝ`, with the fibrewise maximizer set `𝒵` compact,
every fibre over `[a, b]` attaining its maximum, and a local flow at unit
`tt`-speed near `𝒵` along which `F` differentiates to `χF` (the blueprint's
`χ(F)`; supplied by the flow-box lemma `lem:vector-field-flow-near-compact`
once `χ` is a smooth vector field with `χ(tt) = 1`). If `χF ≤ ψ(tt, F)` on
`𝒵`, with `ψ` `C¹` on the strip `[a, b] × ℝ`, and `G` solves `G' = ψ(t, G)`
with `F_max a ≤ G a`, then `F_max t ≤ G t` for all `t ∈ [a, b]`. -/
