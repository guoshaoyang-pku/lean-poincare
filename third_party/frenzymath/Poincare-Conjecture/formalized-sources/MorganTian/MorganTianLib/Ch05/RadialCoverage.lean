# Morgan--Tian Chapter 5: natural-radius radial coverage

The compact-stage properness bridge is phrased for every real radius.  In
applications the available exhaustion often supplies the stronger-looking but
more concrete statement at natural radii.  This file records the Archimedean
cofinality step explicitly, leaving the geometric natural-radius coverage
hypothesis visible.

/-- **Math.** Coverage of each natural-radius closed ball by its corresponding
compact stage implies the all-real-radius coverage needed for properness. -/

/-! The natural-radius adapter is a special case of the following cofinal
radius form.  This is the form used when compact limits are indexed by a
radius sequence chosen during diagonal extraction. -/

/-- **Math.** Coverage of the closed ball of radius `r n` by stage `n`, for a
cofinal radius sequence, implies the all-real-radius coverage needed for
properness. -/

/-- **Math.** Eventual coverage along a cofinal radius sequence still implies
properness: a sufficiently late stage simultaneously exceeds any prescribed
radius and lies in the eventual coverage tail. -/

/-- **Math.** The image of an earlier compact stage is contained in every later
stage image.  This iterates the consecutive compatibility maps, and is useful
when a coverage statement is only known beyond a finite prefix. -/

/-- **Math.** Eventual natural-radius coverage, together with nested stage
images, suffices for properness of the completed common ambient.  The finite
prefix of stages is irrelevant because a sufficiently large later stage
contains each prescribed bounded ball. -/

stage image, then the increasing stage images exhaust the completed limit. -/
