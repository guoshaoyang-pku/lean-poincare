/-! # C¹ dependence of ODE solutions on the initial condition

For an autonomous ODE `x' = f(x)` on a real Banach space `E`, a solution on `[0, T]` with
initial value `x` is exactly a fixed point of the Picard integral operator, i.e. a zero of the
**Picard residual**

`G(x, α) = α - const x - ∫₀ᵗ f(α(s)) ds`

viewed as a map `E × C([0,T], E) → C([0,T], E)` on the Banach space of continuous curves.
Let `α₀` be a base solution with initial value `x₀`, staying in an open set on which `f` is
differentiable with derivative `f'` continuous along `α₀`. The residual `G` is *strictly*
differentiable at `(x₀, α₀)`: the only nonlinearity is the superposition (Nemytskii) operator
`α ↦ f ∘ α`, whose strict derivative at `α₀` is postcomposition with the operator curve
`A₀ = (t ↦ f' (α₀ t))` — a mean-value-inequality argument, made uniform in `t` by compactness
of the range of `α₀` (Heine). If moreover `T · ‖A₀‖ < 1`, the partial derivative of
`G` in the curve variable is a perturbation `1 - J ∘ M` of the identity by an operator of norm
`< 1`, hence invertible by the Neumann series. The Banach-space implicit function theorem
(`Mathlib.Analysis.Calculus.ImplicitFunction.ProdDomain`) then yields: any solution family
`σ : E → C([0,T], E)` with `σ x₀ = α₀`, continuous at `x₀` and satisfying the integral
equation near `x₀`, is *strictly differentiable* at `x₀`, with derivative characterized by the
linearized (variational) integral equation `D v - ∫₀ᵗ A₀ (D v) = const v`.

The special case `α₀ = const x₀` at an equilibrium (`f x₀ = 0`) is stated separately
(`hasStrictFDerivAt_of_picardResidual`); there the derivative equation is solvable in closed
form when `f' x₀` is nilpotent, which is what the geodesic application at the center of a
normal neighborhood uses. The general (non-equilibrium) form is the C¹-dependence engine for
differentiating the geodesic flow — hence the exponential map — away from the zero section.

This is the "C¹ dependence on initial conditions" infrastructure of
do Carmo, *PetersenLib Geometry*, Ch. 3, §2.2/2.5/2.7 (smooth dependence on initial
conditions), in the form needed to differentiate the geodesic flow in its initial condition at
the center of a normal neighborhood: a downstream file applies the main theorem to the geodesic
spray (whose linearization at a zero-velocity equilibrium is two-step nilpotent) to obtain
`d(exp_p)_0 = id` as a *strict* derivative.

Main declarations:

* `PetersenLib.FlowDependence.intervalPrimitive` — the Volterra primitive
  `β ↦ (t ↦ ∫₀ᵗ β)` as a continuous linear operator of norm `≤ T`;
* `PetersenLib.FlowDependence.postcomp` — postcomposition `α ↦ A ∘ α` by a continuous linear
  map, with `‖postcomp A‖ ≤ ‖A‖`; `postcompCurve` — postcomposition by a continuous *family*
  `A : C(K, E →L[ℝ] F)` of linear maps, with `‖postcompCurve A‖ ≤ ‖A‖`;
* `PetersenLib.FlowDependence.superposition` — the Nemytskii operator `α ↦ f ∘ α`, and
  `hasStrictFDerivAt_superposition`, its strict differentiability at an arbitrary base curve
  (with the constant-curve special case `hasStrictFDerivAt_superposition_const`);
* `PetersenLib.FlowDependence.picardResidual` — the residual of the Picard integral equation,
  `picardResidual_eq_zero_of_hasDerivWithinAt` (solutions of the ODE are zeros) and
  `picardResidual_const_eq_zero` (the equilibrium constant curve is a zero);
* `PetersenLib.FlowDependence.hasStrictFDerivAt_of_picardResidual_curve` — the main theorem:
  strict differentiability of a solution family in its initial condition along an arbitrary
  base solution, with the existence form `exists_hasStrictFDerivAt_of_picardResidual_curve`
  (the derivative produced by the Neumann series), the evaluation corollary
  `hasStrictFDerivAt_eval_of_picardResidual_curve`, and the equilibrium special case
  `hasStrictFDerivAt_of_picardResidual` / `hasStrictFDerivAt_eval_of_picardResidual`;
* `PetersenLib.FlowDependence.linearRamp` and `sub_intervalPrimitive_postcomp_ramp` — the
  explicit solution `D = const + ramp ∘ A` of the derivative equation when `A ∘L A = 0`,
  discharging the characterization hypothesis in the nilpotent (geodesic) application.

/-- **Math.** Strict differentiability of the superposition operator at an arbitrary base
curve: if `f` is differentiable on an open set `u` containing the (compact) range of
`α₀ : C(K, E)`, with derivative `f'` continuous at every point of that range, then `α ↦ f ∘ α`
is strictly differentiable at `α₀`, with derivative postcomposition by the operator curve
`t ↦ f' (α₀ t)` (supplied as any continuous family `A₀` agreeing with it pointwise).

The proof is the mean value inequality along the base curve, made uniform in `t` by
compactness of the range: `f'` is uniformly continuous at the range (Heine), so for curves
`α, β` uniformly close to `α₀` the pointwise error `f (α t) - f (β t) - f' (α₀ t) (α t - β t)`
is `≤ ε ‖α t - β t‖` simultaneously for all `t`. This generalizes the constant-curve case
`hasStrictFDerivAt_superposition_const` from equilibria to arbitrary base solutions — the step
needed to differentiate a flow in its initial condition away from an equilibrium. -/

/-! ## Main theorem: strict differentiability in the initial condition -/

/-- **Math.** **Strict differentiability of a solution family in its initial condition, along
an arbitrary base solution** (do Carmo, PetersenLib Geometry, Ch. 3, §2.2/2.5/2.7 — C¹
dependence of ODE solutions on initial conditions, non-equilibrium case). Let `α₀` be a base
solution curve with initial value `x₀`, staying in an open set `u` on which `f` is
differentiable, with derivative `f'` continuous at every point of the curve, and let
`A₀ = (t ↦ f' (α₀ t))` be the operator curve along it. Suppose `T ‖A₀‖ < 1`. If
`σ : E → C([0,T], E)` is a family of curves with `σ x₀ = α₀`, continuous at `x₀`, satisfying
the Picard integral equation `picardResidual (x, σ x) = 0` for all `x` near `x₀`, and if `D`
solves the linearized (variational) integral equation `D v - ∫₀ᵗ A₀(s) ((D v)(s)) ds = const v`,
then `σ` is strictly differentiable at `x₀` with derivative `D`. The proof applies the Banach
implicit function theorem to the Picard residual, whose curve-partial derivative `1 - J ∘ M`
along the base solution is invertible by the Neumann series. -/

/-! ## From pointwise strict differentiability to C¹

A function that is *strictly* differentiable at every point of an open set is automatically
`C¹` there: the strict estimates at two nearby base points hold on a common pair-ball, and
comparing them on that ball forces the two derivatives to be close in operator norm. This
upgrades the pointwise strict-differentiability conclusions of the theorems above (obtained
at each initial condition separately) to genuine `C¹` regularity on open sets. -/

/-- **Math.** If `f` is strictly differentiable at every point of an open set `s`, then the
derivative map `x ↦ f' x` is continuous on `s`. (For `x, x'` close, the strict estimates at
`x` and at `x'` both control the same difference quotients on a small common ball, so
`‖f' x' - f' x‖` is small: pointwise strict differentiability self-improves to continuity of
the derivative.) -/
